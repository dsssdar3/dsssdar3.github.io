Despite being diagnosed with ALS at age 21, which left him almost entirely paralyzed, Hawking continued to work and inspire millions with his discoveries, books, and lectures. His best-selling book, 'A Brief History of Time,' made complex concepts in astrophysics accessible to the general public, significantly increasing interest in the field.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To focus on the commercial success of 'A Brief History of Time' and its impact on the publishing industry", "B": "To provide a detailed explanation of Hawking's theories and their significance in advancing astrophysics", "C": "To argue that Hawking's perseverance in the face of adversity is the primary reason for his widespread popularity", "D": "To highlight Stephen Hawking's resilience in overcoming physical limitations and his contributions to the field of astrophysics"}, "explanation": "D: 'To highlight Stephen Hawking's resilience in overcoming physical limitations and his contributions to the field of astrophysics' is the correct answer because the passage discusses Hawking's groundbreaking work in astrophysics, his physical challenges, and his ability to inspire millions.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a detailed explanation of Hawking's theories and their significance in advancing astrophysics' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the specifics of his theories, but rather focuses on his resilience and contributions.", "'To argue that Hawking's perseverance in the face of adversity is the primary reason for his widespread popularity' is incorrect because the passage does not claim that his perseverance is the main reason for his popularity, but rather emphasizes his scientific contributions and ability to inspire.", "'To focus on the commercial success of 'A Brief History of Time' and its impact on the publishing industry' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the book's success and does not discuss its impact on the publishing industry."], "id": 22011}]
