[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "Photovoltaic engineering involves designing and optimizing solar energy systems. In order to maximize the efficiency of these systems, engineers must consider various factors such as the orientation and ______ of solar panels, as well as the type of materials used.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "weight", "B": "color", "C": "tilt", "D": "texture"}, "explanation": "C: 'tilt' is the correct answer because the tilt of solar panels affects the amount of sunlight they can capture and thus influences their efficiency.", "distractor_explanation": ["'color' is incorrect because the color of solar panels does not play a significant role in their efficiency.", "'weight' is incorrect because the weight of solar panels is not a critical factor in optimizing the system.", "'texture' is incorrect because the texture of solar panels does not have a significant impact on their efficiency."], "id": 23344}]
