[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Skeletons are essential for providing structure and support to living organisms. In vertebrates, the skeletal system comprises bones, cartilage, and ligaments that collectively perform crucial functions. They protect internal organs, facilitate movement, and even assist in the production of blood cells. While humans have an endoskeleton, some animals, such as insects and crustaceans, possess an exoskeleton, providing support from the outside.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To briefly explain the significance of skeletons and highlight the differences between endoskeletons and exoskeletons", "B": "To extensively describe the various components of vertebrate and invertebrate skeletal systems", "C": "To argue that endoskeletons are more effective and advantageous than exoskeletons for living organisms", "D": "To analyze the evolutionary processes that led to the development of endoskeletons and exoskeletons"}, "explanation": "A: 'To briefly explain the significance of skeletons and highlight the differences between endoskeletons and exoskeletons' is the correct answer because the passage provides an overview of the functions of skeletons and mentions the difference between endoskeletons and exoskeletons.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To extensively describe the various components of vertebrate and invertebrate skeletal systems' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the components of the skeletal system in vertebrates and does not delve into the components of invertebrate skeletal systems.", "'To argue that endoskeletons are more effective and advantageous than exoskeletons for living organisms' is incorrect because the passage does not make any comparisons between the effectiveness or advantages of endoskeletons and exoskeletons.", "'To analyze the evolutionary processes that led to the development of endoskeletons and exoskeletons' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss evolutionary processes or the development of skeletal systems."], "id": 22046}]
