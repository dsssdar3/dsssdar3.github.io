[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Johannes Kepler, a key figure in the scientific revolution, formulated three major laws of planetary motion that laid the groundwork for modern astronomy. His first law, established in 1609, stated that planets orbit the sun in an elliptical, rather than circular, path. _______ in 1619, he introduced his second law, which posits that a planet's orbital speed changes as it moves closer to or farther from the sun.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Subsequently", "B": "Alternatively", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "A: 'Subsequently' is the correct answer because it indicates that the introduction of Kepler's second law logically followed the establishment of his first law, showing a progression in his discoveries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it implies an alternative or different option to the first law, rather than a chronological progression of his discoveries.", "'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or exception to his first law, which is not the case.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies similarity between the laws, but not the chronological progression in Kepler's discoveries."], "id": 24374}]
