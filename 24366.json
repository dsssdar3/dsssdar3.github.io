The second sentence offers an example of how Faulkner uses Yoknapatawpha County in his works.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it implies that the second sentence offers an alternative to the first statement, when it actually provides an example of how Faulkner uses Yoknapatawpha County in his works."], "id": 24366}]
