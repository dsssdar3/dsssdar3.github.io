[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was an Austrian physicist best known for his work on quantum mechanics. He is particularly famous for his wave equation, which describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. _______ Schr\u00f6dinger also authored the thought experiment known as Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, which is frequently used to illustrate the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand", "B": "However", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Additionally"}, "explanation": "D: 'Additionally' is the correct answer because it logically connects the two sentences by indicating that Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is another significant contribution of Schr\u00f6dinger to the field of quantum mechanics, in addition to his wave equation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'However' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between the two ideas, when in fact both sentences discuss Schr\u00f6dinger's contributions to quantum mechanics.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a difference or opposition between the two sentences, when they are actually discussing related aspects of Schr\u00f6dinger's work.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies an alternative or contrasting idea, whereas the passage is discussing two of Schr\u00f6dinger's important contributions to quantum mechanics."], "id": 23558}]
