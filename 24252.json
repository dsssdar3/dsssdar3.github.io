His work on germ theory revolutionized medicine and public health. Pasteur developed the process of pasteurization to prevent the spoilage of milk and other beverages, making them safer to consume. His relentless research also led to the development of vaccines for rabies and anthrax, ultimately saving countless lives.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Louis Pasteur's research led to the development of vaccines for all infectious diseases", "B": "Louis Pasteur solely focused on the pasteurization process to improve the quality of beverages", "C": "Louis Pasteur's significant contributions in microbiology greatly impacted medicine and public health", "D": "Louis Pasteur's work in germ theory overshadowed his other contributions in microbiology"}, "explanation": "C: 'Louis Pasteur's significant contributions in microbiology greatly impacted medicine and public health' is the correct answer because the passage discusses his work on germ theory, pasteurization, and the development of vaccines for rabies and anthrax.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Louis Pasteur solely focused on the pasteurization process to improve the quality of beverages' is incorrect because the passage mentions other aspects of his work, such as germ theory and the development of vaccines.", "'Louis Pasteur's research led to the development of vaccines for all infectious diseases' is incorrect because the passage only mentions vaccines for rabies and anthrax.", "'Louis Pasteur's work in germ theory overshadowed his other contributions in microbiology' is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that his work on germ theory overshadowed his other achievements."], "id": 24252}]
