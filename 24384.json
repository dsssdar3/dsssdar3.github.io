[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that all living things have a specific purpose or function. These functions are determined by their nature, which is an inherent quality. For instance, the function of an acorn is to become an oak tree. _______ Aristotle argued that humans have a unique function, which he called rational activity, the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Similarly,", "B": "Nevertheless,", "C": "In contrast,", "D": "On the other hand,"}, "explanation": "A: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it logically connects the idea of living things having a specific function to Aristotle's claim that humans have a unique function.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or exception to the previous statement, which is not the case here.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a difference or opposition to the previous statement, which is not appropriate in this context.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative or contrasting point, whereas the passage is building upon the same idea."], "id": 24384}]
