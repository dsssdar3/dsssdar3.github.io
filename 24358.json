[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Thomas Hardy, a renowned Victorian novelist and poet, was born in 1840 in Dorset, England. His literary works are characterized by a strong sense of place and a focus on rural life. Many of his novels are set in the fictional region of Wessex, which is based on his native Dorset. _______ Hardy's works often examine the social constraints and class divisions of the time, leading to tragic outcomes for his characters.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "In contrast", "B": "Additionally", "C": "However", "D": "For example"}, "explanation": "B: 'Additionally' is the correct answer because it logically connects the information about Hardy's focus on rural life and the fictional region of Wessex with the additional theme of social constraints and class divisions in his works.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies opposition between the two pieces of information, rather than showing how they are related.", "'However' is incorrect because it suggests a contradiction between the two points, whereas they are complementary.", "'For example' is incorrect because it implies that the second point is merely an instance of the first, rather than an additional theme in Hardy's works."], "id": 24358}]
