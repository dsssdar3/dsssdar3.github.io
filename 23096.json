They claim that while the programs provided much-needed relief to millions of struggling Americans, they did not address the underlying economic issues that caused the depression. Additionally, some argue that the New Deal overstepped the bounds of the federal government and set a dangerous precedent for government intervention in the economy."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would critics of the New Deal (Text 2) most likely respond to the relief programs like CCC and PWA discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By stating that these programs were solely responsible for ending the Great Depression", "B": "By arguing that these programs were unnecessary and did not have any positive impact on the economy", "C": "By suggesting that the New Deal programs were only created to increase the political power of the federal government", "D": "By acknowledging the relief provided by these programs but asserting that they did not address the root causes of the Great Depression"}, "explanation": "D: 'By acknowledging the relief provided by these programs but asserting that they did not address the root causes of the Great Depression' is the correct answer because Text 2 mentions that critics argue the programs provided relief but did not successfully end the Great Depression.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By stating that these programs were solely responsible for ending the Great Depression' is incorrect because Text 2 states that critics believe the New Deal did not truly end the Great Depression.", "'By arguing that these programs were unnecessary and did not have any positive impact on the economy' is incorrect because Text 2 acknowledges that the programs provided relief to millions of Americans.", "'By suggesting that the New Deal programs were only created to increase the political power of the federal government' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the effectiveness of the programs rather than their motivations."], "id": 23096}]
