[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) is a widely used approach that involves using computer software to simulate and analyze the performance of a design before it is built. This method can save time and money by identifying potential problems early in the development process.", "text_2": "While CAE has proven to be a valuable tool in the engineering industry, some experts argue that it can also lead to overconfidence in designs.
