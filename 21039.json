[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Coastal engineering is a specialized field that focuses on designing and constructing infrastructure to protect coastlines from erosion and flooding. Engineers use various techniques, such as constructing seawalls, breakwaters, and groins, to mitigate the impacts of waves, tides, and storms on coastal communities. Coastal engineers also play a vital role in the planning and development of sustainable coastal management strategies to preserve natural habitats and promote economic growth.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To emphasize the role of government agencies in regulating coastal engineering projects and initiatives", "B": "To argue that coastal engineering is the most critical field in the realm of engineering disciplines", "C": "To describe the daily work routine and challenges faced by coastal engineers in their profession", "D": "To introduce the field of coastal engineering and its importance in protecting coastlines and promoting sustainable development"}, "explanation": "D: 'To introduce the field of coastal engineering and its importance in protecting coastlines and promoting sustainable development' is the correct answer because the passage provides an overview of coastal engineering, its focus on designing infrastructure, and its role in sustainable coastal management.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that coastal engineering is the most critical field in the realm of engineering disciplines' is incorrect because the passage does not make any comparison with other engineering fields.", "'To describe the daily work routine and challenges faced by coastal engineers in their profession' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the specifics of their daily work or challenges.", "'To emphasize the role of government agencies in regulating coastal engineering projects and initiatives' is incorrect because the passage does not mention government agencies or their roles in regulation."], "id": 21039}]
