[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Johannes Kepler, a key figure in the scientific revolution, was a German astronomer and mathematician. He is best known for his laws of planetary motion, which describe the orbits of planets around the sun. Kepler's work laid the foundation for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation and greatly influenced the development of modern astronomy.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Kepler's theories were met with skepticism during his time, causing friction among the scientific community.", "B": "Kepler collaborated with Isaac Newton to develop the laws of planetary motion and universal gravitation.", "C": "Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion significantly impacted the scientific revolution and modern astronomy.", "D": "Kepler's work focused primarily on the development of advanced tools and instruments for astronomical observation."}, "explanation": "C: 'Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion significantly impacted the scientific revolution and modern astronomy.' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Kepler's contribution to the scientific revolution through his laws of planetary motion and their influence on modern astronomy.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Kepler's theories were met with skepticism during his time, causing friction among the scientific community.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any skepticism or friction.", "'Kepler collaborated with Isaac Newton to develop the laws of planetary motion and universal gravitation.' is incorrect because the passage states that Kepler's work laid the foundation for Newton's theory, but does not mention collaboration.", "'Kepler's work focused primarily on the development of advanced tools and instruments for astronomical observation.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Kepler's focus on tools and instruments."], "id": 22404}]
