[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Max Planck was a groundbreaking physicist whose work remains influential to this day. In 1900, he proposed the idea of energy quanta, which ______ that energy can only be released in discrete units or 'quanta.' This concept laid the groundwork for the development of quantum mechanics.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "asserting", "B": "to assert", "C": "asserted", "D": "will assert"}, "explanation": "C: 'asserted' is the correct answer because it provides a finite past tense verb, consistent with the tense of the passage, to describe Planck's proposal.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to assert' is incorrect because it uses the nonfinite to-infinitive form, which doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'asserting' is incorrect because it uses the nonfinite participle form, which doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'will assert' is incorrect because it uses the future tense, which is inconsistent with the past tense context of the passage."], "id": 23151}]
