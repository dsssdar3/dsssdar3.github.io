[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In photovoltaic engineering, the efficiency of a solar cell is a primary concern. Researchers constantly strive to improve the conversion rate of sunlight into electricity. Several materials and designs have been explored, with varying levels of success. One promising approach involves the use of perovskite solar cells, which have shown great potential for increased efficiency and lower production costs.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The solar cell industry is focusing on reducing production costs for all solar cell types.", "B": "Photovoltaic engineering is mainly concerned with improving solar cell efficiency, with perovskite cells as a promising option.", "C": "Perovskite solar cells have already replaced traditional solar cells in most applications.", "D": "Researchers have found that traditional solar cell materials and designs are no longer worth exploring."}, "explanation": "B: 'Photovoltaic engineering is mainly concerned with improving solar cell efficiency, with perovskite cells as a promising option.' is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the passage's focus on the importance of efficiency in solar cells and the potential of perovskite cells in achieving this goal.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The solar cell industry is focusing on reducing production costs for all solar cell types.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention that all solar cell types are being focused on.", "'Perovskite solar cells have already replaced traditional solar cells in most applications.' is incorrect because the passage does not state that perovskite cells have already replaced traditional cells.", "'Researchers have found that traditional solar cell materials and designs are no longer worth exploring.' is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that traditional materials and designs are no longer valuable."], "id": 21356}]
