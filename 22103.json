[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian playwright and poet, has been celebrated for his use of rich symbolism and mythological themes in his works. Critics often praise Soyinka's ability to weave complex cultural and historical references into his writing, creating depth and meaning for his audiences.", "text_2": "Wole Soyinka's style has been compared to other great literary figures like William Shakespeare and James Joyce. Some scholars, however, argue that these comparisons are superficial, as they overlook the unique ways in which Soyinka incorporates African cultural elements and experiences into his work, setting him apart from Western authors."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the scholars mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to the praise of Soyinka's symbolism and mythological themes discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By asserting that the praise is misplaced, and Soyinka's use of symbolism and mythological themes is derivative of other authors", "B": "By suggesting that the praise is irrelevant and the true value of Soyinka's work lies in its innovative narrative structure", "C": "By agreeing with the praise but emphasizing the importance of recognizing Soyinka's unique incorporation of African cultural elements", "D": "By dismissing the praise entirely, arguing that Soyinka's work lacks the depth and complexity found in the works of Shakespeare and Joyce"}, "explanation": "C: 'By agreeing with the praise but emphasizing the importance of recognizing Soyinka's unique incorporation of African cultural elements' is the correct answer because Text 2 suggests that scholars acknowledge Soyinka's similarities with other great literary figures, but they also argue that his unique incorporation of African cultural elements sets him apart.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that the praise is misplaced, and Soyinka's use of symbolism and mythological themes is derivative of other authors' is incorrect because Text 2 implies that scholars do not dismiss Soyinka's symbolism and themes but rather emphasize his unique qualities.", "'By suggesting that the praise is irrelevant and the true value of Soyinka's work lies in its innovative narrative structure' is incorrect because neither text discusses Soyinka's narrative structure.", "'By dismissing the praise entirely, arguing that Soyinka's work lacks the depth and complexity found in the works of Shakespeare and Joyce' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest that scholars dismiss Soyinka's work as lacking depth and complexity, but rather that they wish to highlight his unique cultural contributions."], "id": 22103}]
