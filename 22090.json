Historically, bobsleighs were constructed primarily of wood, with steel runners for gliding on ice. However, as the sport grew in popularity, the need for faster and more aerodynamic designs became apparent.", "text_2": "In recent years, advancements in bobsleigh construction have led to the use of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber and specialized alloys. These materials, combined with innovative design techniques, have allowed for the development of bobsleighs that are more streamlined and capable of reaching higher speeds."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the advancements in bobsleigh construction (Text 2) most likely respond to the historical construction methods mentioned in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By highlighting that the adoption of modern materials and design techniques has led to significant improvements in bobsleigh performance", "B": "By arguing that the historical use of wood and steel runners was a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to bobsleigh construction", "C": "By asserting that the transition to new materials has made bobsleighs less accessible to aspiring athletes due to increased costs", "D": "By suggesting that the changes in construction materials have had little impact on the overall performance of bobsleighs and are primarily aesthetic"}, "explanation": "A: 'By highlighting that the adoption of modern materials and design techniques has led to significant improvements in bobsleigh performance' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses how the use of lightweight materials and innovative designs has allowed for the development of faster and more streamlined bobsleighs.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that the historical use of wood and steel runners was a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to bobsleigh construction' is incorrect because neither text discusses the environmental impact of bobsleigh materials.", "'By asserting that the transition to new materials has made bobsleighs less accessible to aspiring athletes due to increased costs' is incorrect because neither text addresses the affordability of bobsleighs.", "'By suggesting that the changes in construction materials have had little impact on the overall performance of bobsleighs and are primarily aesthetic' is incorrect because Text 2 specifically mentions that the new materials and designs have improved performance and allowed for higher speeds."], "id": 22090}]
