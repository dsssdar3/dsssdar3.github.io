His work on black holes and the development of the Penrose process for extracting energy from them was significant. _______ Penrose also made important advances in the field of mathematical tiling patterns, known as Penrose tilings.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "However", "B": "Furthermore", "C": "In contrast", "D": "On the other hand"}, "explanation": "B: 'Furthermore' is the correct answer because it logically adds another area of Penrose's contributions, showing not only his work in general relativity and cosmology but also in mathematical tiling patterns.", "distractor_explanation": ["'However' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or conflict between Penrose's work in different fields, rather than showing the extent of his contributions.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a difference or contrast between the two areas of Penrose's work, when the passage is highlighting his achievements in both.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative or contrasting idea between Penrose's accomplishments in general relativity and mathematical tiling patterns, while the passage is emphasizing his contributions to both fields."], "id": 22542}]
