[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Agricultural engineers have developed a new approach to irrigation management called precision agriculture, which allows farmers to optimize water usage. By using advanced technology, such as drones and remote sensors, farmers can collect accurate data on soil moisture levels and plant health. This data is then analyzed to determine the optimal amount of water for each section of the field, reducing water waste and promoting sustainable farming practices.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To emphasize the importance of data analysis in determining the success of agricultural engineering techniques", "B": "To advocate for the widespread adoption of drones and remote sensors in all facets of agriculture", "C": "To describe the development of precision agriculture as a technique for optimizing water usage in farming", "D": "To explore the historical development of irrigation management and its impact on modern farming practices"}, "explanation": "C: 'To describe the development of precision agriculture as a technique for optimizing water usage in farming' is the correct answer because the passage primarily focuses on the innovative approach called precision agriculture and its benefits in optimizing water usage for farmers.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To advocate for the widespread adoption of drones and remote sensors in all facets of agriculture' is incorrect because the passage specifically discusses precision agriculture and its use of technology for irrigation management, not the adoption of drones and sensors in every aspect of agriculture.", "'To emphasize the importance of data analysis in determining the success of agricultural engineering techniques' is incorrect because the passage mainly discusses precision agriculture and its optimization of water usage, while data analysis is only one component of this approach.", "'To explore the historical development of irrigation management and its impact on modern farming practices' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the new approach of precision agriculture and its benefits, not the history of irrigation management."], "id": 21027}]
