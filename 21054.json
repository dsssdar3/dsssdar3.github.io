[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Environmental biotechnology has made significant strides in recent years. Scientists have developed innovative methods to harness the power of natural processes to reduce pollution and clean up contaminated sites. One such method is using microbes to break down hazardous compounds in soil and water. This approach, known as bioremediation, has been successfully employed in a variety of settings, including industrial sites and oil spills, and has shown promise as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional remediation techniques.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To argue against the widespread adoption of environmental biotechnology and advocate for more traditional remediation techniques", "B": "To discuss the limitations of environmental biotechnology and suggest further research on alternative methods", "C": "To provide a detailed account of the various microbes used in bioremediation and their specific roles in breaking down hazardous compounds", "D": "To highlight the progress of environmental biotechnology and emphasize the potential of bioremediation as a sustainable method for pollution cleanup"}, "explanation": "D: 'To highlight the progress of environmental biotechnology and emphasize the potential of bioremediation as a sustainable method for pollution cleanup' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the advancements made in environmental biotechnology, specifically the development of bioremediation as a promising solution for pollution cleanup.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the limitations of environmental biotechnology and suggest further research on alternative methods' is incorrect because the passage mainly discusses the advancements and potential of bioremediation, not its limitations or alternative methods.", "'To provide a detailed account of the various microbes used in bioremediation and their specific roles in breaking down hazardous compounds' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the use of microbes in bioremediation and does not provide a detailed account of their roles.", "'To argue against the widespread adoption of environmental biotechnology and advocate for more traditional remediation techniques' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes the successes of bioremediation and its potential as a sustainable alternative, rather than arguing against its adoption."], "id": 21054}]
