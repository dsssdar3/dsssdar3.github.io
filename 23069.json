[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Brazilian economic miracle refers to a period of exceptional economic growth in Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s. This period saw the country's GDP grow at an average annual rate of over 10%, transforming Brazil into an economic powerhouse.", "text_2": "Critics argue that the Brazilian economic miracle was not a genuine economic success, as it relied heavily on foreign debt and led to increased income inequality.
