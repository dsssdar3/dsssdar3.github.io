[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In thermal engineering, heat transfer plays a crucial role in designing efficient systems. Conduction, convection, and radiation are the three fundamental modes of heat transfer. Conduction involves the transfer of heat between two solid surfaces in contact, while convection occurs between a solid surface and a moving fluid. Radiation, on the other hand, involves the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves without the need for a medium. A thorough understanding of these modes is essential for engineers to optimize the performance of various systems such as heat exchangers, engines, and cooling systems.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue that radiation is the most efficient mode of heat transfer in all engineering applications", "B": "To explain the detailed mathematical equations governing heat transfer in various thermal systems", "C": "To introduce the importance of heat transfer in thermal engineering and identify its three fundamental modes", "D": "To provide a historical overview of the development of thermal engineering and its impact on society"}, "explanation": "C: 'To introduce the importance of heat transfer in thermal engineering and identify its three fundamental modes' is the correct answer because the text focuses on the significance of heat transfer in designing efficient systems and discusses the three modes: conduction, convection, and radiation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To explain the detailed mathematical equations governing heat transfer in various thermal systems' is incorrect because the text does not delve into any mathematical equations.", "'To argue that radiation is the most efficient mode of heat transfer in all engineering applications' is incorrect because the text does not specifically argue that one mode is more efficient than the others.", "'To provide a historical overview of the development of thermal engineering and its impact on society' is incorrect because the text does not discuss any historical context or the impact of thermal engineering on society."], "id": 24015}]
