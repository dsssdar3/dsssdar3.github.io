[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Wireless charging has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the convenience it offers, such as eliminating the need for cords and allowing users to charge multiple devices simultaneously. The technology relies on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which involves creating an electromagnetic field between a transmitter and receiver. _______ some critics argue that the efficiency of wireless charging is still lower than that of traditional charging methods, resulting in longer charging times.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "In fact", "C": "Moreover", "D": "However"}, "explanation": "D: 'However' is the correct answer because it introduces a contrasting point to the previous statement about the convenience and benefits of wireless charging.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In fact' is incorrect because it implies that the following statement supports or strengthens the previous statement, which it does not.", "'Moreover' is incorrect because it suggests that the following statement adds more information to the previous statement, when in reality, it presents a contrasting point.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the following statement is similar to the previous statement, which it is not."], "id": 22572}]
