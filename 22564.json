[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "George Boole, a 19th-century English mathematician and logician, is best known for developing Boolean algebra, a system of symbolic logic that has become the basis of modern digital computer logic. Boole's work in logic was groundbreaking, and his ideas were considered revolutionary at the time. _______ his contributions to mathematics extended beyond the realm of logic, as he also made significant advancements in the field of probability theory.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Moreover", "B": "Conversely", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "Instead"}, "explanation": "A: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it adds additional information about Boole's contributions to mathematics, emphasizing that his work was not limited to logic.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Conversely' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between Boole's work in logic and his work in probability, which is not the case.", "'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it implies that Boole's work in probability was in spite of his work in logic, instead of being another area of his expertise.", "'Instead' is incorrect because it suggests that Boole's work in probability replaced his work in logic, rather than being an additional contribution."], "id": 22564}]
