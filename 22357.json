[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In the field of mining engineering, underground mining is a critical method for extracting valuable minerals. This technique relies on the use of tunnels and shafts to access and remove resources found below the Earth's surface. However, underground mining poses significant risks, such as cave-ins and the release of toxic gases. Engineers must carefully design and implement safety measures to mitigate these risks and ensure the wellbeing of miners.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "The importance of underground mining in accessing valuable resources", "B": "The various methods of underground mining and their applications", "C": "The environmental impact of underground mining on the Earth's surface", "D": "The need for safety measures in underground mining due to inherent risks"}, "explanation": "D: 'The need for safety measures in underground mining due to inherent risks' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the risks associated with underground mining and the role of engineers in designing safety measures to protect miners.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The importance of underground mining in accessing valuable resources' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the significance of this method but rather on its risks and safety measures.", "'The various methods of underground mining and their applications' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss different techniques but rather highlights the risks and safety measures associated with this method.", "'The environmental impact of underground mining on the Earth's surface' is incorrect because the passage does not mention environmental impacts, but instead concentrates on the risks to miners and the need for safety measures."], "id": 22357}]
