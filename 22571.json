[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Nanotechnology is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize various industries, such as medicine, energy, and electronics. One promising application of nanotechnology is the development of nanobots for targeted drug delivery. _______ these tiny machines can be programmed to travel through the human body and release medication directly at the site of infection or disease, minimizing side effects and maximizing treatment efficacy.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "In contrast", "B": "For example", "C": "However", "D": "On the other hand"}, "explanation": "B: 'For example' is the correct answer because it provides a specific example of a promising application of nanotechnology (nanobots for targeted drug delivery) that supports the claim made in the previous sentence about the potential of nanotechnology to revolutionize various industries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between the information in the two sentences, which is not the case. The second sentence provides an example that supports the claim made in the first sentence.", "'However' is incorrect because it suggests a contradiction between the two sentences, which is not the case. The second sentence provides an example that supports the claim made in the first sentence.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies an alternative or contrasting point of view, which is not the case. The second sentence provides an example that supports the claim made in the first sentence."], "id": 22571}]
