[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Market failure occurs when a market cannot efficiently allocate resources to achieve the best possible outcome for society. This often results from externalities, monopolies or oligopolies, asymmetric information, and public goods. Governments may intervene to correct market failures, though such interventions can sometimes create unintended consequences or exacerbate the problem.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that market failures are solely caused by externalities and should be strictly regulated by governments", "B": "To provide a brief overview of market failure and its causes, as well as the potential role of government intervention", "C": "To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various market structures, such as monopolies and oligopolies", "D": "To examine the role of asymmetric information in creating market failures and suggest possible solutions"}, "explanation": "B: 'To provide a brief overview of market failure and its causes, as well as the potential role of government intervention' is the correct answer because the passage introduces the concept of market failure, lists its common causes, and mentions the possibility of government intervention.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that market failures are solely caused by externalities and should be strictly regulated by governments' is incorrect because the passage lists multiple causes of market failure and does not focus solely on externalities or strict government regulation.", "'To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various market structures, such as monopolies and oligopolies' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions these market structures as potential causes of market failure, without going into their advantages or disadvantages.", "'To examine the role of asymmetric information in creating market failures and suggest possible solutions' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions asymmetric information as one of the causes of market failure and does not suggest any solutions."], "id": 24017}]
