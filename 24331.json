The device works by utilizing a biosensor that responds to changes in glucose concentration, and then wirelessly transmits the data to an external device. This could revolutionize the way patients with diabetes track their glucose levels and ______", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "provide a non-invasive alternative to traditional blood tests for diagnosing diabetes in at-risk individuals.", "B": "allow doctors to predict and prevent the onset of diabetes in patients who do not yet have the condition.", "C": "eliminate the need for insulin injections, as the implant would regulate glucose levels autonomously.", "D": "potentially improve their overall health and quality of life through better management of the condition."}, "explanation": "D: 'potentially improve their overall health and quality of life through better management of the condition.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses monitoring blood glucose levels in real time, which would help patients manage their diabetes more effectively, leading to better health outcomes.", "distractor_explanation": ["'allow doctors to predict and prevent the onset of diabetes in patients who do not yet have the condition.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on diabetes management, not prevention.", "'eliminate the need for insulin injections, as the implant would regulate glucose levels autonomously.' is incorrect because the passage only mentions monitoring glucose levels, not regulating them.", "'provide a non-invasive alternative to traditional blood tests for diagnosing diabetes in at-risk individuals.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on managing diabetes in patients who already have the condition, not diagnosing it in at-risk individuals."], "id": 24331}]
