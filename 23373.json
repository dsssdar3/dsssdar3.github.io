[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Combustion engineering is a specialized field that focuses on the science and technology of burning fuels to release energy. This energy is then used to power various machines and systems, such as internal combustion engines and power plants. Experts in this field continuously work on developing more efficient and eco-friendly methods of combustion to minimize the impact on the environment while maximizing energy output.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To advocate for the replacement of combustion engineering with alternative energy sources", "B": "To discuss the historical development of combustion engineering and its various applications", "C": "To provide a detailed analysis of the environmental challenges faced by combustion engineering", "D": "To briefly introduce the field of combustion engineering and its focus on efficient energy production"}, "explanation": "D: 'To briefly introduce the field of combustion engineering and its focus on efficient energy production' is the correct answer because the passage gives a concise overview of the field, mentioning its purpose, applications, and objectives.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To advocate for the replacement of combustion engineering with alternative energy sources' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for replacing combustion engineering, but rather discusses its focus and objectives.", "'To discuss the historical development of combustion engineering and its various applications' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the history or provide a comprehensive list of applications.", "'To provide a detailed analysis of the environmental challenges faced by combustion engineering' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the field's efforts toward eco-friendly methods, without providing an in-depth analysis."], "id": 23373}]
