[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Robert Frost's poetry often explores the relationship between humans and nature. In his poem 'The Road Not Taken,' for example, the narrator is confronted with a choice between two paths in a forest. The poem's final lines, 'Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014 / I ______ the one less traveled by,' express the narrator's decision.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "had taken", "B": "takes", "C": "took", "D": "has taken"}, "explanation": "C: 'took' is the correct answer because the use of the simple past tense verb 'took' expresses the narrator's completed action of choosing the less traveled path, which is consistent with the overall narrative of the poem.", "distractor_explanation": ["'had taken' is incorrect because the past perfect tense is not needed for a simple past action in this context.", "'takes' is incorrect because the present tense does not fit the completed action of choosing a path in the poem.", "'has taken' is incorrect because the present perfect tense is not appropriate for conveying the completed action in the past."], "id": 21155}]
