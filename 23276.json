[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Boundaries", "passage": "Quantum cryptography relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure the secure exchange of information. By encoding data into quantum states, such as the polarization of a photon, quantum cryptography creates keys that are resistant to eavesdropping attempts. Alice and Bob, two common characters in cryptography examples, can exchange messages with confidence knowing that their ______ is secure.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "communications channels'", "B": "communications' channel", "C": "communication channels'", "D": "communication channel"}, "explanation": "D: 'communication channel' is the correct answer because it uses the singular form of both 'communication' and 'channel' which is appropriate in this context, as Alice and Bob share a single channel for exchanging messages.", "distractor_explanation": ["'communications channels'' is incorrect because it uses the plural form of both 'communications' and 'channels', which is not appropriate for a single channel.", "'communications' channel' is incorrect because it uses the plural form of 'communications', which is not appropriate for a single channel.", "'communication channels'' is incorrect because it uses the plural form of 'channels', which is not appropriate for a single channel."], "id": 23276}]
