[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Linus Pauling, a renowned scientist, contributed significantly to the field of chemistry by developing the concept of electronegativity and establishing the nature of the chemical bond. His work in this area led to a greater understanding of molecular structures and their properties.", "text_2": "In addition to his work in chemistry, Linus Pauling was also an advocate for peace and disarmament. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his efforts to promote nuclear disarmament and his opposition to nuclear weapons testing."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the contributions to chemistry discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "By dismissing the relevance of Pauling's work in chemistry, suggesting that his peace efforts were more important", "B": "By acknowledging Pauling's significant impact in chemistry while also emphasizing his contributions to peace and disarmament", "C": "By arguing that Pauling's work on electronegativity had little impact on the scientific community and molecular research", "D": "By claiming that Pauling's efforts to promote nuclear disarmament were a direct result of his work on chemical bonds"}, "explanation": "B: 'By acknowledging Pauling's significant impact in chemistry while also emphasizing his contributions to peace and disarmament' is the correct answer because Text 2 highlights Pauling's advocacy for peace and disarmament, without undermining his achievements in chemistry.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By dismissing the relevance of Pauling's work in chemistry, suggesting that his peace efforts were more important' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest that one aspect of Pauling's work was more important than the other.", "'By arguing that Pauling's work on electronegativity had little impact on the scientific community and molecular research' is incorrect because Text 2 does not contradict or critique the accomplishments mentioned in Text 1.", "'By claiming that Pauling's efforts to promote nuclear disarmament were a direct result of his work on chemical bonds' is incorrect because Text 2 does not establish a direct connection between his work in chemistry and his advocacy for peace."], "id": 21092}]
