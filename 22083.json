[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Galileo Galilei, an Italian astronomer, is well-known for his support of the heliocentric theory, which posits that the Sun is at the center of the solar system with planets orbiting around it. He faced opposition from the Catholic Church, which adhered to the geocentric model, placing Earth at the center. Galileo's discoveries strengthened the heliocentric view, challenging the Church's stance.", "text_2": "Galileo's extensive contributions to science go beyond his support for the heliocentric theory. He improved the telescope, which allowed him to observe celestial bodies more clearly.
