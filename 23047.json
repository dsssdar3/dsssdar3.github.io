[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Synthetic biology, a multidisciplinary field, combines engineering principles with biology to create new biological systems and redesign existing ones. Researchers are interested in designing organisms with abilities beyond their natural counterparts, such as bacteria that can break down pollutants or plants that can produce biofuels. However, the field also raises ethical concerns, as the potential for unintended consequences and misuse is significant. Balancing the potential benefits and risks associated with synthetic biology is crucial as the field progresses.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that synthetic biology should be primarily focused on creating bacteria capable of breaking down pollutants", "B": "To introduce the field of synthetic biology and highlight its potential benefits and associated risks", "C": "To describe the engineering principles that are combined with biology in order to design organisms with new abilities", "D": "To explain the process of redesigning existing biological systems in order to create more efficient biofuel production"}, "explanation": "B: 'To introduce the field of synthetic biology and highlight its potential benefits and associated risks' is the correct answer because the passage provides an overview of synthetic biology, mentions potential applications, and discusses the importance of considering ethical concerns and risks.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that synthetic biology should be primarily focused on creating bacteria capable of breaking down pollutants' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for a specific focus within the field, but rather presents various potential applications.", "'To describe the engineering principles that are combined with biology in order to design organisms with new abilities' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions the combination of engineering principles with biology but does not delve into specific principles.", "'To explain the process of redesigning existing biological systems in order to create more efficient biofuel production' is incorrect because the passage only provides examples of applications, not an explanation of the process involved in redesigning biological systems."], "id": 23047}]
