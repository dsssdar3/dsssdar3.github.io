[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer, played a crucial role in establishing the field of extragalactic astronomy. His work in the 1920s led to the discovery of galaxies beyond the Milky Way and the realization that the universe is expanding.", "text_2": "Hubble's discovery of the expansion of the universe was based on the observation of redshifts in the light spectra of distant galaxies. He found that the farther away a galaxy was, the greater its redshift, indicating that it was moving away from us at a faster pace. This observation became the foundation of Hubble's law, which states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding is proportional to its distance from the observer."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Text 2 most likely respond to the 'crucial role' of Edwin Hubble discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that Hubble's role was overstated and that other astronomers made more significant contributions to extragalactic astronomy", "B": "By emphasizing Hubble's observations of redshifts in distant galaxies, which led to the discovery of the expansion of the universe", "C": "By arguing that Hubble's discovery was a mere coincidence and not the result of his dedicated work in the field of astronomy", "D": "By focusing on Hubble's personal life and downplaying his professional achievements in the realm of extragalactic astronomy"}, "explanation": "B: 'By emphasizing Hubble's observations of redshifts in distant galaxies, which led to the discovery of the expansion of the universe' is the correct answer because Text 2 describes how Hubble's observations of redshifts ultimately led to the discovery of the universe's expansion, supporting his crucial role as mentioned in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By suggesting that Hubble's role was overstated and that other astronomers made more significant contributions to extragalactic astronomy' is incorrect because both texts highlight Hubble's significant contributions to the field.", "'By arguing that Hubble's discovery was a mere coincidence and not the result of his dedicated work in the field of astronomy' is incorrect because Text 2 does not imply that Hubble's discovery was coincidental.", "'By focusing on Hubble's personal life and downplaying his professional achievements in the realm of extragalactic astronomy' is incorrect because Text 2 does not discuss Hubble's personal life and instead focuses on his professional accomplishments."], "id": 23119}]
