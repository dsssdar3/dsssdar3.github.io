[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Timothy Berners-Lee, often regarded as the inventor of the World Wide Web, intended for his creation to be a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing. However, as the Web grew, Berners-Lee observed that it ______ increasingly commercialized and controlled by a few large corporations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "became", "B": "had become", "C": "is becoming", "D": "will become"}, "explanation": "A: 'became' is the correct answer because it maintains the past tense narrative and indicates that the Web's increasing commercialization and control by large corporations happened in the past, which is consistent with the intended meaning.", "distractor_explanation": ["'is becoming' is incorrect because it uses the present progressive tense, which is inconsistent with the past tense narrative of the passage.", "'had become' is incorrect because the past perfect tense suggests that the event occurred before another past event, which is not the intended meaning.", "'will become' is incorrect because it uses the future tense, which is inconsistent with the past tense narrative of the passage."], "id": 24102}]
