[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Albert Einstein, a physicist who developed the theory of relativity, was born in Germany in 1879. As a young student, he struggled with the rigid educational system, which relied on memorizing facts rather than fostering creativity. However, Einstein's curiosity and passion for learning ______ him to excel in his studies and pursue a career in physics.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "to enable", "B": "enabled", "C": "enabling", "D": "had enabled"}, "explanation": "B: 'enabled' is the correct answer because it provides the passage with a finite verb in the past tense to match the context of the text.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to enable' is incorrect because it uses the nonfinite to-infinitive form, which does not provide a finite verb for the main clause.", "'enabling' is incorrect because it uses the nonfinite participle form, which does not provide a finite verb for the main clause.", "'had enabled' is incorrect because it uses the past perfect tense, which is not necessary for the context of the passage."], "id": 23144}]
