[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Henry David Thoreau, a prominent American philosopher and writer, advocated for a simple life in harmony with nature. His book, Walden, reflects his thoughts and experiences while living in a small cabin near Walden Pond. Thoreau believed in self-reliance, solitude, and the importance of individual introspection.", "text_2": "Some critics argue that Thoreau's ideas are idealistic and impractical in the modern world. They believe that his emphasis on self-reliance and solitude undermines the importance of community, collaboration, and social interaction. Furthermore, they argue that his ideas do not account for the complexities of the contemporary world."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the critics (Text 2) most likely respond to Thoreau's emphasis on self-reliance and solitude discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging the importance of self-reliance and solitude, but suggesting that they are overemphasized in Thoreau's work", "B": "By asserting that Thoreau's ideas are outdated and irrelevant, as they were formed in a time before modern technology and societal structures", "C": "By arguing that Thoreau's focus on self-reliance and solitude downplays the significance of community, collaboration, and social interaction", "D": "By claiming that Thoreau's ideas are only applicable to those who live in rural areas and do not resonate with urban dwellers"}, "explanation": "C: 'By arguing that Thoreau's focus on self-reliance and solitude downplays the significance of community, collaboration, and social interaction' is the correct answer because Text 2 presents critics who argue that Thoreau's ideas are impractical in the modern world and undermine the importance of community, collaboration, and social interaction.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By acknowledging the importance of self-reliance and solitude, but suggesting that they are overemphasized in Thoreau's work' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention acknowledging the importance of Thoreau's ideas.", "'By asserting that Thoreau's ideas are outdated and irrelevant, as they were formed in a time before modern technology and societal structures' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the impracticality of his ideas rather than their relevance.", "'By claiming that Thoreau's ideas are only applicable to those who live in rural areas and do not resonate with urban dwellers' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention rural or urban areas as factors in their criticism."], "id": 22106}]
