[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Thermal engineering expert Dr. Williams has developed a new method for calculating the efficiency of heat exchangers in power plants. By analyzing the heat transfer rate and temperature differential, Dr. Williams can predict the potential energy output of a power plant more accurately than traditional methods.", "text_2": "Dr. Patel, another thermal engineering specialist, has studied the relationship between the size of the heat exchanger and its overall performance. Dr. Patel found a significant decline in efficiency as the heat exchanger size increases, suggesting that smaller heat exchangers could provide better performance."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Patel (Text 2) most likely respond to the new method for calculating efficiency discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": " By acknowledging the potential improvements in prediction accuracy while emphasizing the importance of heat exchanger size", "B": " By asserting that the new method is revolutionary and will change the way power plants are designed and operated", "C": " By disputing the accuracy of Dr. Williams' method and recommending alternative approaches to improve the predictions", "D": " By dismissing the relevance of the new method, claiming that heat transfer rate and temperature differential are insignificant factors"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the potential improvements in prediction accuracy while emphasizing the importance of heat exchanger size' is the correct answer because Dr. Patel's findings support the idea that heat exchanger size plays a significant role in efficiency, which is not mentioned in Dr. Williams' method.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By disputing the accuracy of Dr. Williams' method and recommending alternative approaches to improve the predictions' is incorrect because Dr. Patel's research does not directly contradict Dr. Williams' method.", "'By asserting that the new method is revolutionary and will change the way power plants are designed and operated' is incorrect because Dr. Patel's research focuses on heat exchanger size and its impact on efficiency.", "'By dismissing the relevance of the new method, claiming that heat transfer rate and temperature differential are insignificant factors' is incorrect because Dr. Patel's research does not provide any evidence to refute the importance of these factors."], "id": 22087}]
