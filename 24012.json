[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Albert Einstein is widely celebrated for his theory of relativity, which changed the way we understand the world. His famous equation, E=mc\u00b2, demonstrates the relationship between energy and mass, leading to the discovery of nuclear energy. However, Einstein was also a pacifist and expressed concern about the destructive power of nuclear weapons. He advocated for disarmament and peaceful international cooperation.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue that Einstein's pacifist beliefs were hypocritical given his role in the development of nuclear energy", "B": "To explore the history of nuclear energy and its consequences on global politics and conflict", "C": "To highlight Albert Einstein's contributions to science and his concern for the implications of his discoveries", "D": "To discuss the scientific community's reaction to Einstein's theory of relativity and its impact on future research"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight Albert Einstein's contributions to science and his concern for the implications of his discoveries' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Einstein's theory of relativity, his equation E=mc\u00b2, and his concern about nuclear weapons.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To explore the history of nuclear energy and its consequences on global politics and conflict' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Einstein's scientific contributions and his concern for their implications, not on the broader history of nuclear energy.", "'To argue that Einstein's pacifist beliefs were hypocritical given his role in the development of nuclear energy' is incorrect because the passage does not make any argument about hypocrisy, but instead acknowledges Einstein's concerns about the destructive power of nuclear weapons.", "'To discuss the scientific community's reaction to Einstein's theory of relativity and its impact on future research' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the scientific community's reaction or the impact on future research, but rather focuses on Einstein's contributions and concerns."], "id": 24012}]
