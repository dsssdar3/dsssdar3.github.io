The novel features a gripping tale of love and revenge, set in the moors of Yorkshire. _______ it was initially met with mixed reviews, as many critics found the story too dark and disturbing. Over time, however, the novel has gained recognition for its complex characters and its exploration of social and moral issues.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Nevertheless", "B": "In addition", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "A: 'Nevertheless' is the correct answer because it indicates a contrast between the novel's current status as a classic and its initial reception by critics.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In addition' is incorrect because it implies that the mixed reviews were an additional positive aspect, rather than a contrast to the novel's current status.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that does not exist between the novel's current status and its initial reception.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the mixed reviews were similar to the novel's status as a classic, rather than contrasting with it."], "id": 24365}]
