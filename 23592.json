[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Galileo Galilei, a key figure in the scientific revolution, made significant contributions to the fields of astronomy, physics, and mathematics. He was the first person to observe celestial objects, such as the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus, using a telescope. _______ Galileo's discoveries led to his support for the heliocentric model of the solar system, which placed the Sun at the center rather than Earth.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Similarly,", "B": "In contrast,", "C": "As a result,", "D": "Nonetheless,"}, "explanation": "C: 'As a result' is the correct answer because it logically connects Galileo's observations of celestial objects to his support of the heliocentric model. The transition word indicates that his discoveries were a consequence of his observations.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests an opposition or difference between his observations and his support for the heliocentric model, which is not the case.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the two ideas are similar, but the passage is discussing a cause-and-effect relationship between Galileo's observations and his support for the heliocentric model.", "'Nonetheless' is incorrect because it suggests that there is a contrast or exception between his observations and his support for the heliocentric model, when in fact they are connected."], "id": 23592}]
