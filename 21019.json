Subsidies can take various forms, such as direct cash grants, tax breaks, or low-interest loans. Critics argue that subsidies can distort markets, encourage inefficiencies, or favor certain sectors unfairly. Proponents claim that they help protect domestic industries, create jobs, and foster innovation, especially in emerging industries.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue in favor of subsidies as a means to stimulate economic growth and job creation", "B": "To provide an overview of subsidies and the contrasting opinions regarding their benefits and drawbacks", "C": "To criticize subsidies as a market-distorting mechanism that leads to inefficiencies and unfairness", "D": "To describe the various forms of subsidies available and their specific applications in different industries"}, "explanation": "B: 'To provide an overview of subsidies and the contrasting opinions regarding their benefits and drawbacks' is the correct answer because the passage explains what subsidies are and briefly mentions the arguments for and against them.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue in favor of subsidies as a means to stimulate economic growth and job creation' is incorrect because the passage presents both positive and negative views on subsidies rather than arguing in favor of them.", "'To criticize subsidies as a market-distorting mechanism that leads to inefficiencies and unfairness' is incorrect because the passage does not solely focus on the negative aspects of subsidies, but also mentions their potential benefits.", "'To describe the various forms of subsidies available and their specific applications in different industries' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions the forms of subsidies but does not delve into their specific applications."], "id": 21019}]
