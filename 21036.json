[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Control engineering focuses on the design and implementation of control systems for various applications. By using mathematical models, engineers can predict and analyze the behavior of systems to develop appropriate control strategies. These strategies can optimize system performance, improve safety, and minimize energy consumption. Control engineering plays a crucial role in industries such as aerospace, manufacturing, and robotics, ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of complex systems.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To examine the various mathematical models used in control engineering for system analysis", "B": "To highlight the importance of control engineering in optimizing system performance and improving safety", "C": "To discuss the role of control engineering in the development of the aerospace industry", "D": "To argue that control engineering is the most essential field of engineering for the future"}, "explanation": "B: 'To highlight the importance of control engineering in optimizing system performance and improving safety' is the correct answer because the passage emphasizes the role of control engineering in enhancing system performance, safety, and energy efficiency.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To examine the various mathematical models used in control engineering for system analysis' is incorrect because although the passage mentions the use of mathematical models, it does not focus on examining them.", "'To discuss the role of control engineering in the development of the aerospace industry' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions aerospace as one of the industries where control engineering is applied.", "'To argue that control engineering is the most essential field of engineering for the future' is incorrect because the passage does not make such a claim or argument."], "id": 21036}]
