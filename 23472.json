[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Command of Evidence", "passage": "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, developed the periodic table of elements based on his periodic law. He left gaps in the table for undiscovered elements and even predicted their properties. Mendeleev's periodic table led to the discovery of elements like germanium, gallium, and scandium.", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the idea that Mendeleev's periodic table was influential in the discovery of new elements?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Mendeleev struggled to find a publisher for his original periodic table manuscript.", "B": "Mendeleev's periodic table was not widely accepted by the scientific community during his lifetime.", "C": "The properties of germanium, gallium, and scandium closely matched Mendeleev's predictions.", "D": "The periodic table has undergone numerous revisions since Mendeleev's initial publication."}, "explanation": "C: 'The properties of germanium, gallium, and scandium closely matched Mendeleev's predictions.' is the correct answer because it demonstrates that Mendeleev's periodic table was not only a tool for organizing known elements but also for accurately predicting the properties of undiscovered ones.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Mendeleev's periodic table was not widely accepted by the scientific community during his lifetime.' is incorrect because it does not provide evidence of the periodic table's influence on the discovery of new elements.", "'Mendeleev struggled to find a publisher for his original periodic table manuscript.' is incorrect because it does not show the impact of Mendeleev's work on the discovery of new elements.", "'The periodic table has undergone numerous revisions since Mendeleev's initial publication.' is incorrect because it does not indicate whether Mendeleev's original periodic table contributed to the discovery of new elements."], "id": 23472}]
