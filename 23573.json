[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Wind engineering is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on analyzing and optimizing the effects of wind on structures, such as buildings and bridges. Wind engineers use computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing to predict wind loads and ensure that structures can withstand extreme wind conditions. _______ they also implement design measures, such as aerodynamic modifications and dampers, to minimize the impact of wind-induced vibrations and improve structural stability.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Alternatively", "D": "Moreover"}, "explanation": "D: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it logically signals that the detail in this sentence\u2014that wind engineers implement design measures to minimize the impact of wind-induced vibrations and improve stability\u2014adds to the information in the previous sentence about predicting wind loads and ensuring structural stability.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it illogically signals that the detail in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating an additional aspect of wind engineering.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is an alternative to the information in the previous sentence.
