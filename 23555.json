His work often explored themes of racial identity and the African American experience. For instance, his poem 'I, Too, Sing America' highlights the importance of African American voices in the national narrative. _______ in his novel 'Not Without Laughter,' Hughes addresses the challenges faced by a young African American boy growing up in the early 20th century.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Similarly,", "B": "Alternatively,", "C": "In contrast,", "D": "On the other hand,"}, "explanation": "A: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it logically shows that both the poem and the novel mentioned in the passage deal with themes related to the African American experience.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it implies that the two works deal with unrelated themes, which is not the case.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests that the novel addresses a theme that is opposite to the poem, which is not true.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between the works that is not present in the passage."], "id": 23555}]
