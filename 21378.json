Hooke, a prominent English scientist and inventor, observed thin slices of cork under a microscope and noticed tiny, box-like structures that he called 'cells.' This discovery laid the foundation for the field of cell biology and sparked further research into the microscopic world, revolutionizing our understanding of living organisms.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "The text primarily focuses on various inventions and accomplishments of Robert Hooke.", "B": "The text highlights the specific method Hooke used to examine cork slices.", "C": "The text emphasizes the importance of Hooke's discovery of cells in the development of cell biology.", "D": "The text argues that Hooke's discovery was a direct result of advancements in microscope technology."}, "explanation": "C: 'The text emphasizes the importance of Hooke's discovery of cells in the development of cell biology' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Hooke's observation of cells in cork slices and how it laid the foundation for the field of cell biology.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The text primarily focuses on various inventions and accomplishments of Robert Hooke' is incorrect because the passage specifically discusses Hooke's discovery of cells, not his other inventions or accomplishments.", "'The text highlights the specific method Hooke used to examine cork slices' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions Hooke's use of a microscope and does not elaborate on his methodology.", "'The text argues that Hooke's discovery was a direct result of advancements in microscope technology' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the relationship between microscope advancements and Hooke's discovery, but rather focuses on the significance of the discovery itself."], "id": 21378}]
