[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist, played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II. His work at Bletchley Park, the center of British codebreaking efforts, led to the development of the Bombe machine, which greatly accelerated the process of deciphering encrypted messages. Turing's contributions not only helped the Allies win the war but also laid the groundwork for modern computing and artificial intelligence.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To provide a detailed account of the working mechanisms of the Bombe machine", "B": "To highlight the significance of Alan Turing's contributions to codebreaking and modern computing", "C": "To discuss the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence in warfare", "D": "To explore the personal life and relationships of Alan Turing"}, "explanation": "B: 'To highlight the significance of Alan Turing's contributions to codebreaking and modern computing' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Turing's role in breaking the Enigma code and how his work laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a detailed account of the working mechanisms of the Bombe machine' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the Bombe machine and does not delve into its workings.", "'To discuss the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence in warfare' is incorrect because the passage does not address any ethical concerns.", "'To explore the personal life and relationships of Alan Turing' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Turing's professional achievements rather than his personal life."], "id": 23011}]
