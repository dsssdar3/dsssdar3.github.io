[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Argentine economic crisis of 2001 led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and political instability. The government's decision to peg the Argentine peso to the US dollar resulted in a decrease in exports and an increase in external debt.", "text_2": "Some economists argue that the root cause of the Argentine economic crisis was the inflexible monetary policy of pegging the peso to the US dollar. They believe that this policy limited the government's ability to respond to economic shocks and prevented necessary adjustments to maintain economic stability."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the economists in Text 2 most likely respond to the government's pegging decision discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "By agreeing that the pegging decision was necessary to maintain economic stability and prevent further damage to the economy.", "B": "By asserting that the inflexible monetary policy exacerbated the crisis and hindered the government's ability to react effectively.", "C": "By suggesting that the pegging decision had no significant impact on the economic crisis and that other factors were responsible.", "D": "By recommending that the government should have pegged the peso to another currency to avoid the negative consequences of the crisis."}, "explanation": "B: 'By asserting that the inflexible monetary policy exacerbated the crisis and hindered the government's ability to react effectively.' is the correct answer because Text 2 highlights the economists' belief that the pegging decision limited the government's ability to respond to economic shocks and maintain stability.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By agreeing that the pegging decision was necessary to maintain economic stability and prevent further damage to the economy.' is incorrect because Text 2 argues that the pegging decision actually limited the government's ability to maintain stability.", "'By suggesting that the pegging decision had no significant impact on the economic crisis and that other factors were responsible.' is incorrect because Text 2 specifically identifies the pegging decision as a root cause of the crisis.", "'By recommending that the government should have pegged the peso to another currency to avoid the negative consequences of the crisis.' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest an alternative pegging strategy, but rather critiques the inflexible monetary policy."], "id": 22059}]
