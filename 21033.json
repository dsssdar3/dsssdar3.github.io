In 1948, he published a groundbreaking paper titled 'A Mathematical Theory of Communication,' which laid the foundation for modern digital communication and data compression. Shannon's work has had a profound impact on various fields, including telecommunications, computer science, cryptography, and even genetics.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To argue that Claude Shannon's work on information theory was controversial and divisive in his time", "B": "To describe the life and personal achievements of Claude Shannon, the father of information theory", "C": "To discuss the specific mathematical techniques used by Claude Shannon in his foundational paper", "D": "To highlight Claude Shannon's significant contributions to information theory and various fields"}, "explanation": "D: 'To highlight Claude Shannon's significant contributions to information theory and various fields' is the correct answer because the text focuses on Shannon's groundbreaking paper and its impact on multiple areas of study.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To describe the life and personal achievements of Claude Shannon, the father of information theory' is incorrect because the text mainly focuses on Shannon's work and its impact rather than his personal life.", "'To discuss the specific mathematical techniques used by Claude Shannon in his foundational paper' is incorrect because the text does not delve into the specific techniques he used in his paper.", "'To argue that Claude Shannon's work on information theory was controversial and divisive in his time' is incorrect because the text does not mention any controversy or division surrounding his work."], "id": 21033}]
