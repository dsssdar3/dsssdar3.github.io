[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Scientists have developed a new method to edit genes, called CRISPR. This powerful tool allows researchers to alter the genetic code in living organisms with unprecedented precision. By utilizing CRISPR, scientists can target and modify specific genes, potentially eliminating genetic diseases and enhancing desirable traits. While the technique holds enormous potential, ethical concerns arise regarding the alteration of the human genome and its potential impact on future generations.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "The passage primarily argues for the widespread adoption of CRISPR to eliminate genetic diseases.", "B": "The passage focuses on the process of developing CRISPR and its impact on the scientific community.", "C": "The passage discusses CRISPR as a gene-editing tool and highlights its potential benefits and ethical concerns.", "D": "The passage emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in gene-editing research."}, "explanation": "C: 'The passage discusses CRISPR as a gene-editing tool and highlights its potential benefits and ethical concerns.' is the correct answer because it accurately captures the main idea of the text, which introduces CRISPR as a powerful gene-editing tool and mentions both its potential applications and the ethical concerns surrounding its use.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The passage focuses on the process of developing CRISPR and its impact on the scientific community.' is incorrect because the passage does not describe the development process of CRISPR, but rather focuses on its potential applications and ethical concerns.", "'The passage primarily argues for the widespread adoption of CRISPR to eliminate genetic diseases.' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for widespread adoption, but rather provides a balanced view of CRISPR's potential benefits and ethical concerns.", "'The passage emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in gene-editing research.' is incorrect because the passage does mention ethical considerations, but it does not emphasize them over the potential benefits of CRISPR."], "id": 21380}]
