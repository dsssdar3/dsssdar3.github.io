[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "George Boole, a 19th-century English mathematician, laid the foundation for modern digital computer systems with his invention of Boolean algebra. His system of logic, which uses binary operations and variables, provided a simple yet powerful method for representing complex logical relationships. Boole's work has had a profound impact on various fields, including computer science, electronics, and artificial intelligence, as it enabled the development of digital circuits and computer programming languages.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue that George Boole's Boolean algebra is the most significant development in the history of mathematics", "B": "To provide a detailed explanation of George Boole's personal life and his struggles in developing Boolean algebra", "C": "To highlight George Boole's contribution to modern digital computer systems through his invention of Boolean algebra", "D": "To compare and contrast George Boole's work with other mathematicians who contributed to the field of computer science"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight George Boole's contribution to modern digital computer systems through his invention of Boolean algebra' is the correct answer because the text focuses on describing how George Boole's invention of Boolean algebra laid the foundation for modern digital computer systems and its impact on various fields.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a detailed explanation of George Boole's personal life and his struggles in developing Boolean algebra' is incorrect because the text does not mention his personal life or any struggles he faced.", "'To argue that George Boole's Boolean algebra is the most significant development in the history of mathematics' is incorrect because the text does not make such a comparison or claim.", "'To compare and contrast George Boole's work with other mathematicians who contributed to the field of computer science' is incorrect because the text solely focuses on George Boole and his invention of Boolean algebra."], "id": 21002}]
