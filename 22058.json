[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Systems engineer Dr. Emily Thompson and her team have developed an innovative systems engineering approach that focuses on optimizing the balance between subsystems while maintaining overall system efficiency. This method has led to significant improvements in various industries, such as automotive and aerospace manufacturing.", "text_2": "In contrast, systems engineer Dr. Alex Johnson and colleagues have proposed a different approach to systems engineering. They emphasize the importance of addressing individual subsystem performance and reliability before integrating them into the larger system.
