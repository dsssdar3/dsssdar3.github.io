[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "This passage discusses Christiaan Huygens, a prominent 17th-century Dutch mathematician, astronomer, and physicist. Huygens made significant contributions to the fields of mechanics, optics, and horology. He is best known for his work on the physics of light, particularly his wave theory of light, which laid the groundwork for future developments in the field. Additionally, Huygens invented the pendulum clock, which greatly improved the accuracy of timekeeping and had a profound impact on navigation and scientific research.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Christiaan Huygens made significant contributions to various scientific fields, particularly light physics and timekeeping.", "B": "Huygens' wave theory of light was immediately accepted by the scientific community.", "C": "Huygens' contributions to mechanics and optics overshadowed his work in horology.", "D": "The invention of the pendulum clock was Huygens' only noteworthy accomplishment."}, "explanation": "A: 'Christiaan Huygens made significant contributions to various scientific fields, particularly light physics and timekeeping.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses Huygens' contributions to mechanics, optics, and horology, highlighting his work on the physics of light and the invention of the pendulum clock.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Huygens' contributions to mechanics and optics overshadowed his work in horology.' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Huygens' contributions to both light physics and timekeeping.", "'Huygens' wave theory of light was immediately accepted by the scientific community.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the immediate acceptance of Huygens' wave theory of light.", "'The invention of the pendulum clock was Huygens' only noteworthy accomplishment.' is incorrect because the passage also discusses his work on the physics of light, along with contributions to mechanics, optics, and horology."], "id": 21410}]
