[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Machine translation systems have made significant advances in recent years, primarily due to the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. These systems can now produce translations that are often as accurate as those produced by human translators. _______ there are still challenges to overcome, such as accurately translating idiomatic expressions, preserving cultural nuances, and maintaining the original tone and style of the text.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "In addition", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Nonetheless"}, "explanation": "D: 'Nonetheless' is the correct answer because it indicates a contrast or exception to the previous statement, acknowledging the progress in machine translation systems while also pointing out the existing challenges.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In addition' is incorrect because it implies that the challenges mentioned are simply more examples of the progress made by machine translation systems, rather than contrasting or exceptional points.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it suggests a conclusion or consequence based on the previous statement, which is not the case for the challenges mentioned.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it indicates a similarity with the previous statement, while the sentence actually highlights the challenges that remain despite the progress in machine translation systems."], "id": 22576}]
