[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Speech recognition technology has made significant advancements in recent years, enabling more accurate transcription and interpretation of human speech. Early speech recognition systems struggled with understanding accents and dialects, often producing inaccurate transcriptions. _______ researchers have been able to improve these systems by implementing deep learning algorithms and training them using large datasets from various linguistic backgrounds.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "However", "C": "For example", "D": "In contrast"}, "explanation": "B: 'However' is the correct answer because it logically signals a contrast between the early speech recognition systems' struggles and the improvements achieved by researchers using deep learning algorithms.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it illogically signals that the improvements in speech recognition systems are similar to their previous struggles.", "'For example' is incorrect because it implies that the information about deep learning algorithms is an example of the struggles faced by early speech recognition systems, which is not the case.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies that the improvements in speech recognition systems are in contrast to the early struggles, which is not the intended meaning. The intended meaning is to highlight the progress made from the early struggles."], "id": 23584}]
