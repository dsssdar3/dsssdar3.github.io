[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Optogenetics is a technique that combines genetics and optics to control the activity of individual neurons in living tissue. By using light to stimulate specific neurons, researchers can better understand how neural circuits work. However, optogenetics has some limitations, such as the difficulty of delivering light to deep brain structures without causing damage. Scientists are currently working on solutions to overcome these challenges, such as ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "developing new methods to deliver light more efficiently and safely to targeted neurons.", "B": "using alternative techniques that do not rely on light to control neuronal activity.", "C": "relying solely on genetic manipulation to understand neural circuits without using light.", "D": "abandoning optogenetics altogether in favor of less invasive research methods."}, "explanation": "A: 'Developing new methods to deliver light more efficiently and safely to targeted neurons' is the correct answer because it directly addresses the limitation mentioned in the passage and suggests that scientists are working to improve the technique.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Using alternative techniques that do not rely on light to control neuronal activity' is incorrect because the passage specifically discusses optogenetics, which involves the use of light.", "'Relying solely on genetic manipulation to understand neural circuits without using light' is incorrect because it ignores the fact that optogenetics is a combination of genetics and optics.", "'Abandoning optogenetics altogether in favor of less invasive research methods' is incorrect because the passage states that scientists are working on solutions to overcome the challenges, not abandoning the technique."], "id": 23509}]
