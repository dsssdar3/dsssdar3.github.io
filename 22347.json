[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "Wind engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, focuses on predicting and mitigating the impact of wind on buildings, bridges, and other structures. In the design process, engineers often use wind tunnels to simulate various wind scenarios and _______ their designs for the potential effects.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "complicate", "B": "optimize", "C": "disregard", "D": "obscure"}, "explanation": "B: 'optimize' is the correct answer because it indicates that engineers use wind tunnels to improve their designs, taking into account the potential effects of wind.", "distractor_explanation": ["'complicate' is incorrect because engineers would not intentionally make their designs more complex due to wind.", "'disregard' is incorrect because it suggests that engineers do not consider the wind's impact, which is contrary to the purpose of wind engineering.", "'obscure' is incorrect because it implies that engineers are trying to hide or make their designs unclear, which is not the goal of wind engineering."], "id": 22347}]
