[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Bobsleigh, a winter sport invented in the late 19th century, involves teams of two or four athletes racing down an ice-covered track in a sled. The sleds are designed to minimize air resistance and, with the help of gravity, they can reach speeds of up to 93 miles per hour (150 km/h). To steer the sled, the pilot ______ subtle body movements to manipulate the runners.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "is used", "B": "uses", "C": "had used", "D": "using"}, "explanation": "B: 'uses' is the correct answer because it provides the main clause with the necessary finite verb in the present tense, fitting the context of describing how the pilot steers the sled.", "distractor_explanation": ["'is used' is incorrect because it implies that the pilot is being used by something else to steer the sled, which is not the intended meaning.", "'had used' is incorrect because the past perfect tense is not consistent with the present tense used to describe the sport.", "'using' is incorrect because it is a nonfinite verb form that does not supply the main clause with a finite verb."], "id": 22118}]
