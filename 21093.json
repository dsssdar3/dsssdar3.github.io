[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Literary critic Sarah Orne Jewett praised Willa Cather's writing for its ability to capture the spirit of the American West. Jewett argued that Cather's vivid descriptions and character development brought the landscapes and people of the West to life for readers.", "text_2": "In contrast, critic H. L. Mencken criticized Cather's work, claiming that her stories were too focused on the mundane aspects of life in the American West. Mencken believed that the lack of dramatic events in her work made it less engaging for readers."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mencken (Text 2) most likely respond to Jewett's praise (Text 1) of Cather's ability to capture the spirit of the American West?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By arguing that Cather's focus on mundane aspects detracts from the spirit of the West.", "B": "By asserting that Cather's work accurately captures the spirit of the West, but lacks engaging dramatic events.", "C": "By suggesting that Jewett's praise is unwarranted due to a lack of understanding of the American West.", "D": "By recommending that literary critics focus on other aspects of Cather's work, such as her narrative structure."}, "explanation": "A: 'By arguing that Cather's focus on mundane aspects detracts from the spirit of the West.' is the correct answer because Mencken (Text 2) criticizes Cather's work for being too focused on the mundane aspects of life in the American West and believes this makes her work less engaging for readers.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that Cather's work accurately captures the spirit of the West, but lacks engaging dramatic events.' is incorrect because Mencken (Text 2) does not acknowledge that Cather's work captures the spirit of the West.", "'By suggesting that Jewett's praise is unwarranted due to a lack of understanding of the American West.' is incorrect because Mencken (Text 2) does not question Jewett's understanding of the American West.", "'By recommending that literary critics focus on other aspects of Cather's work, such as her narrative structure.' is incorrect because Mencken (Text 2) does not suggest focusing on other aspects of Cather's work."], "id": 21093}]
