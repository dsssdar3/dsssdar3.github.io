[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Bioprocess engineering involves the optimization of biological processes for manufacturing products such as pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and food. A crucial aspect of bioprocess engineering is the design of bioreactors, which provide an environment for microorganisms to carry out the desired reactions. However, scaling up from laboratory-scale bioreactors to industrial-scale ones presents challenges with respect to ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "discovering novel biological processes for manufacturing products", "B": "finding suitable microorganisms capable of carrying out desired reactions", "C": "maintaining optimal conditions for microorganism growth and product formation", "D": "developing new types of bioreactors that can function at a smaller scale"}, "explanation": "C: 'maintaining optimal conditions for microorganism growth and product formation' is the correct answer because the passage talks about challenges in scaling up bioreactors, which implies issues related to maintaining suitable conditions as the size of the bioreactor increases.", "distractor_explanation": ["'finding suitable microorganisms capable of carrying out desired reactions' is incorrect because the passage focuses on bioreactor design, not the selection of microorganisms.", "'discovering novel biological processes for manufacturing products' is incorrect because the passage is about the challenges in scaling up bioreactors, not discovering new processes.", "'developing new types of bioreactors that can function at a smaller scale' is incorrect because the passage discusses challenges in scaling up, not scaling down or creating smaller bioreactors."], "id": 21470}]
