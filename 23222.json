[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Rhetorical Synthesis", "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: \u2022 Medical imaging technologies include MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound. \u2022 MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of internal structures. \u2022 CT scans combine multiple X-ray images to generate cross-sectional views of the body. \u2022 Ultrasound relies on high-frequency sound waves to produce images of internal organs.", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to describe the similarities and differences among the medical imaging technologies mentioned?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "MRI and CT scans both use X-rays to generate images, while ultrasound uses sound waves.", "B": "Medical imaging technologies such as MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound all use different methods to create images of the human body.", "C": "Ultrasound is the only medical imaging technology that doesn't use radiation, while MRI and CT scans do.", "D": "MRI employs magnetic fields and radio waves, CT scans use multiple X-ray images, and ultrasound utilizes high-frequency sound waves for imaging internal structures."}, "explanation": "D: 'MRI employs magnetic fields and radio waves, CT scans use multiple X-ray images, and ultrasound utilizes high-frequency sound waves for imaging internal structures.' is the correct answer because it accurately describes the differences in the methods used by each of the medical imaging technologies mentioned in the notes.", "distractor_explanation": ["'MRI and CT scans both use X-rays to generate images, while ultrasound uses sound waves.' is incorrect because MRI does not use X-rays.", "'Medical imaging technologies such as MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound all use different methods to create images of the human body.' is incorrect because it doesn't provide specific information about each technology.", "'Ultrasound is the only medical imaging technology that doesn't use radiation, while MRI and CT scans do.' is incorrect because MRI does not use radiation."], "id": 23222}]
