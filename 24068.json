[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is often considered the world's first computer programmer due to her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. She developed an algorithm for the machine to compute Bernoulli numbers, demonstrating the potential for the engine to solve problems beyond simple calculations.", "text_2": "Some historians argue that Ada Lovelace's contributions to computer science have been overemphasized, as her work was only a small part of the Analytical Engine's development.
