[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In 2018, transportation engineers developed an innovative traffic management system to mitigate congestion in urban areas. The system utilized advanced sensors and artificial intelligence to monitor traffic patterns and adjust traffic signals accordingly. By analyzing the flow of vehicles and predicting peak traffic hours, the system optimized signal timings, improving traffic flow and reducing travel times. The successful implementation of this traffic management system has already led to a significant decrease in traffic congestion and an increase in overall transportation efficiency.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To compare the effectiveness of traditional traffic management techniques with those incorporating artificial intelligence", "B": "To describe the creation and implementation of a traffic management system designed to alleviate urban congestion", "C": "To explore the funding and resources necessary for cities to adopt new traffic management technologies", "D": "To debate the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence in transportation engineering"}, "explanation": "B: 'To describe the creation and implementation of a traffic management system designed to alleviate urban congestion' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the development and success of an innovative traffic management system that improved traffic flow and reduced congestion.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To compare the effectiveness of traditional traffic management techniques with those incorporating artificial intelligence' is incorrect because the passage does not mention or compare traditional traffic management techniques.", "'To explore the funding and resources necessary for cities to adopt new traffic management technologies' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss funding or resources needed for implementation.", "'To debate the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence in transportation engineering' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any ethical concerns or debates related to the use of artificial intelligence in traffic management systems."], "id": 22006}]
