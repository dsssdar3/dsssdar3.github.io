[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter explores themes of sin and guilt in Puritan New England. The novel's protagonist, Hester Prynne, ______ a red letter 'A' on her chest, symbolizing her adulterous affair and public shaming.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "has worn", "B": "wears", "C": "worn", "D": "will wear"}, "explanation": "B: 'wears' is the correct answer because it uses the present tense, which is consistent with the conventions of discussing a literary work, and it indicates that Hester Prynne's action of wearing the red letter 'A' is an ongoing event in the novel.", "distractor_explanation": ["'has worn' is incorrect because the present perfect tense is less suitable for discussing events in a literary work.", "'worn' is incorrect because it is a past participle, and it doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'will wear' is incorrect because the future tense is not appropriate when discussing events in a literary work."], "id": 24099}]
