[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Tina Callahan, a chemical engineer, has developed an innovative method for breaking down plastic waste using a specialized enzyme. This enzyme, when applied to plastic materials, can rapidly degrade them into their constituent components. The process is more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional methods, which often involve burning or burying plastic waste. Callahan's breakthrough could revolutionize the way we handle plastic pollution and contribute to a more sustainable future.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To explain the process of creating enzymes and their applications in various industries", "B": "To discuss the history of chemical engineering and its impact on environmental issues", "C": "To highlight Tina Callahan's development of an enzyme-based method for breaking down plastic waste", "D": "To argue for the implementation of more stringent regulations on plastic waste disposal"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight Tina Callahan's development of an enzyme-based method for breaking down plastic waste' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Tina Callahan's invention and how it could potentially change the way we handle plastic pollution.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the history of chemical engineering and its impact on environmental issues' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Tina Callahan's specific invention, not the history of chemical engineering.", "'To explain the process of creating enzymes and their applications in various industries' is incorrect because the passage is primarily about the application of a specific enzyme for breaking down plastic waste.", "'To argue for the implementation of more stringent regulations on plastic waste disposal' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for any regulatory changes, but rather focuses on the innovative solution developed by Tina Callahan."], "id": 24006}]
