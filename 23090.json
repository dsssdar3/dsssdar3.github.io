He argues that a single gene mutation may not fully explain the severity of the disease, as other genes could also contribute to its manifestation. Thus, to develop more effective treatments, researchers must investigate the complex interplay of multiple genes."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. James Park (Text 2) most likely respond to the discovery made by Dr. Sarah Thompson's team (Text 1)?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": " By acknowledging the discovery but stressing the need to investigate the role of genetic modifiers", "B": " By dismissing the discovery as irrelevant to the development of effective treatments", "C": " By applauding the discovery as the ultimate solution for the rare hereditary disease", "D": " By suggesting that the discovery is a result of flawed research methodology"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the discovery but stressing the need to investigate the role of genetic modifiers' is the correct answer because, in Text 2, Dr. James Park highlights the importance of understanding the role of genetic modifiers in rare hereditary diseases and suggests that a single gene mutation may not fully explain the severity of the disease.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By applauding the discovery as the ultimate solution for the rare hereditary disease' is incorrect because Dr. Park emphasizes the need to investigate the role of genetic modifiers.", "'By dismissing the discovery as irrelevant to the development of effective treatments' is incorrect because Dr. Park does not dismiss the importance of gene discoveries, but rather stresses the need to understand the role of genetic modifiers.", "'By suggesting that the discovery is a result of flawed research methodology' is incorrect because Dr. Park does not criticize the research methodology but highlights the importance of considering genetic modifiers in understanding rare hereditary diseases."], "id": 23090}]
