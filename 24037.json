[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Artificial photosynthesis, an innovative technology, aims to replicate the natural process of photosynthesis to produce clean energy. Researchers focus on developing efficient methods to capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy, similar to how plants do. This technology holds great potential in addressing the growing global energy demands while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Besides energy production, artificial photosynthesis could aid in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thus mitigating climate change impacts.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To introduce artificial photosynthesis as a promising technology for clean energy production and climate change mitigation", "B": "To discuss the various techniques used by researchers to develop artificial photosynthesis systems", "C": "To argue that artificial photosynthesis is superior to other renewable energy sources in terms of efficiency and sustainability", "D": "To examine the potential negative impacts of artificial photosynthesis on ecosystems and biodiversity"}, "explanation": "A: 'To introduce artificial photosynthesis as a promising technology for clean energy production and climate change mitigation' is the correct answer because the passage mainly focuses on presenting the concept of artificial photosynthesis and its potential benefits in addressing energy needs and climate change.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the various techniques used by researchers to develop artificial photosynthesis systems' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions the research focus but does not go into detail about specific techniques.", "'To argue that artificial photosynthesis is superior to other renewable energy sources in terms of efficiency and sustainability' is incorrect because the passage does not compare artificial photosynthesis to other renewable energy sources.", "'To examine the potential negative impacts of artificial photosynthesis on ecosystems and biodiversity' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss any negative impacts of the technology."], "id": 24037}]
