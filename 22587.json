[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, made groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of mathematics, physics, and astronomy. He developed the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics. _______ Newton also made significant contributions to the field of optics, where he formulated the theory of colors and invented the reflecting telescope.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Instead", "B": "Moreover", "C": "However", "D": "On the other hand"}, "explanation": "B: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it logically signals that the information in this sentence, about Newton's contributions to the field of optics, adds to the information in the previous sentences about his discoveries in mathematics, physics, and astronomy.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Instead' is incorrect because it illogically signals that Newton's contributions to the field of optics are an alternative to his discoveries in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, rather than an addition to them.", "'However' is incorrect because it illogically signals that Newton's contributions to the field of optics contrast with his discoveries in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, rather than complementing them.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it illogically signals that Newton's contributions to the field of optics are a contrast or alternative to his discoveries in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, rather than an addition to them."], "id": 22587}]
