[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "The Andes Mountains, known for their unique biodiversity, have been extensively studied by researchers. These mountains are home to various ecosystems, including cloud forests, dry forests, and p\u00e1ramo grasslands, which support a diverse range of flora and fauna. The Andes' rich biodiversity is a result of ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "the presence of a large number of geothermal vents, providing warmth and nutrients to support a wide range of species", "B": "a single dominant species that has shaped the characteristics of all other organisms inhabiting the region", "C": "a lack of human intervention, as the harsh conditions of the Andes Mountains have prevented human civilizations from forming", "D": "the interplay of distinct ecological zones and varying altitudes, leading to the evolution of species adapted to specific environments"}, "explanation": "D: 'the interplay of distinct ecological zones and varying altitudes, leading to the evolution of species adapted to specific environments' is the correct answer because the passage mentions the various ecosystems present in the Andes Mountains, which support a diverse range of flora and fauna. This implies that the diversity is due to the different environments created by these ecosystems.", "distractor_explanation": ["'a single dominant species that has shaped the characteristics of all other organisms inhabiting the region' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes the diversity of ecosystems and species found in the Andes, which would not be consistent with a single dominant species controlling the region.", "'a lack of human intervention, as the harsh conditions of the Andes Mountains have prevented human civilizations from forming' is incorrect because although the Andes have harsh conditions, the passage does not mention human intervention or lack thereof as a reason for the region's biodiversity.", "'the presence of a large number of geothermal vents, providing warmth and nutrients to support a wide range of species' is incorrect because the passage does not mention geothermal vents as a factor contributing to the biodiversity of the Andes Mountains."], "id": 22498}]
