[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Genome editing, also known as gene editing, is a group of technologies that enable scientists to alter an organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome. _______ this has greatly increased the efficiency and precision of genetic modification, leading to a surge in research and potential applications. One of the most promising applications is the treatment of genetic diseases, as gene editing can potentially correct the faulty genes responsible for these conditions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand", "B": "As a result", "C": "In contrast", "D": "However"}, "explanation": "B: 'As a result' is the correct answer because it logically signals a consequence of the gene editing technologies mentioned earlier in the passage.", "distractor_explanation": ["'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or alternative, which is not the case in this passage.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or difference, which is not the case in this passage.", "'However' is incorrect because it indicates a contrast or exception, which is not the case in this passage."], "id": 22555}]
