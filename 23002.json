[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Isaac Newton, a renowned mathematician and physicist, made significant contributions to various scientific fields. One of his most notable achievements was the formulation of the three laws of motion, which laid the groundwork for classical mechanics. Additionally, Newton developed the law of universal gravitation, a theory that explained the force responsible for keeping celestial bodies in orbit. His discoveries greatly influenced the scientific community and continue to impact modern physics.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To argue the superiority of Newton's contributions to scientific knowledge over those of his contemporaries", "B": "To discuss the personal life and character traits of Isaac Newton as an influential scientist", "C": "To provide a detailed account of Isaac Newton's discovery of the law of universal gravitation", "D": "To highlight Isaac Newton's notable achievements in the fields of physics and mathematics"}, "explanation": "D: 'To highlight Isaac Newton's notable achievements in the fields of physics and mathematics' is the correct answer because the passage mainly focuses on Newton's significant contributions, such as the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the personal life and character traits of Isaac Newton as an influential scientist' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any aspects of Newton's personal life or character.", "'To provide a detailed account of Isaac Newton's discovery of the law of universal gravitation' is incorrect because the passage mentions this discovery but does not delve into the details of how it was made.", "'To argue the superiority of Newton's contributions to scientific knowledge over those of his contemporaries' is incorrect because the passage does not compare Newton's work to that of other scientists during his time."], "id": 23002}]
