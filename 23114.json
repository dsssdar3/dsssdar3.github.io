[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "John Keats, a major Romantic poet, was known for his odes, such as 'Ode to a Nightingale' and 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' These poems explore the themes of beauty, the passage of time, and the relationship between art and nature. Some critics argue that Keats' odes demonstrate an idealization of art as a means of transcending the limitations of human existence.", "text_2": "In contrast, other scholars believe that Keats' odes reveal a deep engagement with the realities of human life, including pain and suffering. They argue that his poetry does not seek to escape the human condition, but rather to confront it, acknowledging that beauty and suffering are intertwined."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the scholars in Text 2 most likely respond to the idea of 'idealization of art' discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By challenging the notion that Keats' odes idealize art as an escape from the human condition, emphasizing the confrontation of reality.", "B": "By asserting that Keats' focus on art as a means of transcending human existence is a central theme in his odes.", "C": "By suggesting that Keats' odes are primarily concerned with the artistic representation of nature and its beauty.", "D": "By agreeing that Keats' odes do idealize art, but arguing that this idealization is balanced by a focus on the passage of time and human limitations."}, "explanation": "A: 'By challenging the notion that Keats' odes idealize art as an escape from the human condition, emphasizing the confrontation of reality.' is the correct answer because Text 2 argues that Keats' poetry confronts the realities of human life and does not seek to escape from them.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By suggesting that Keats' odes are primarily concerned with the artistic representation of nature and its beauty.' is incorrect because it does not address the scholars' view in Text 2 on the relationship between art and the human condition.", "'By asserting that Keats' focus on art as a means of transcending human existence is a central theme in his odes.' is incorrect because it aligns with the view presented in Text 1 rather than the opposing view in Text 2.", "'By agreeing that Keats' odes do idealize art, but arguing that this idealization is balanced by a focus on the passage of time and human limitations.' is incorrect because Text 2 does not agree with the idea that Keats' odes idealize art as an escape from the human condition."], "id": 23114}]
