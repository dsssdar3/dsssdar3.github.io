[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "Machine learning algorithms are widely used to make predictions and classify data. When training a machine learning model, it is crucial to maintain a balance between bias and variance to ensure accurate predictions. Overfitting occurs when the model is too ______ to the training data, limiting its ability to generalize to new data.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "unresponsive", "B": "exposed", "C": "sensitive", "D": "resistant"}, "explanation": "C: 'sensitive' is the correct answer because it accurately describes a model that is too closely aligned with the training data, leading to overfitting and limiting its ability to generalize to new data.", "distractor_explanation": ["'exposed' is incorrect because it does not convey the idea of overfitting in the context of machine learning models.", "'unresponsive' is incorrect because it suggests the model is not affected by the training data, which is the opposite of overfitting.", "'resistant' is incorrect because it implies the model is not influenced by the training data, which contradicts the concept of overfitting."], "id": 24202}]
