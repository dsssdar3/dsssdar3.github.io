[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. In such situations, the market may fail to provide the socially optimal level of a good or service. This can occur due to a number of factors, such as the existence of externalities, public goods, and asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. When market failures arise, government intervention may be required to correct the inefficiencies and promote social welfare.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The passage focuses on how government intervention always leads to market failures.", "B": "The passage primarily explains market failure and the potential need for government intervention.", "C": "The passage mainly discusses the various factors that contribute to the success of a free market.", "D": "The passage emphasizes the role of asymmetric information in creating market failures."}, "explanation": "B: 'The passage primarily explains market failure and the potential need for government intervention' is the correct answer because it accurately captures the main idea of the text, which is about market failure and the circumstances that may necessitate government intervention.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The passage focuses on how government intervention always leads to market failures' is incorrect because the passage actually discusses how government intervention may be required to correct market failures, not cause them.", "'The passage mainly discusses the various factors that contribute to the success of a free market' is incorrect because the passage discusses factors that can lead to market failures, not those that contribute to market success.", "'The passage emphasizes the role of asymmetric information in creating market failures' is incorrect because although asymmetric information is mentioned as one of the factors, the passage does not emphasize it over the other factors, and the main idea is broader than just asymmetric information."], "id": 21404}]
