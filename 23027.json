[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In recent years, energy engineering has focused on improving the efficiency of renewable energy sources. Scientists have been researching ways to optimize solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants. As a result, these renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuel-based power generation. Furthermore, advances in energy storage solutions have made it easier to manage the intermittent nature of renewable energy, which has long been a major challenge in the field.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To provide a detailed analysis of the technical aspects involved in improving the efficiency of renewable energy sources", "B": "To argue that renewable energy sources will soon completely replace traditional fossil fuel-based power generation", "C": "To highlight the challenges that remain in the field of energy engineering despite advances in renewable energy", "D": "To emphasize the progress made in energy engineering regarding renewable energy sources and their competitiveness"}, "explanation": "D: 'To emphasize the progress made in energy engineering regarding renewable energy sources and their competitiveness' is the correct answer because the passage mainly discusses the improvements made in renewable energy efficiency and how they are becoming increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that renewable energy sources will soon completely replace traditional fossil fuel-based power generation' is incorrect because the passage does not present an argument, but rather describes the progress made in energy engineering.", "'To highlight the challenges that remain in the field of energy engineering despite advances in renewable energy' is incorrect because the passage focuses more on the progress made and does not emphasize the remaining challenges.", "'To provide a detailed analysis of the technical aspects involved in improving the efficiency of renewable energy sources' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the technical details of the advancements."], "id": 23027}]
