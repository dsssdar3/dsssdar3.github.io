While some resources, such as solar and wind power, are renewable and can be replenished over time, others like fossil fuels and minerals are non-renewable and deplete as they are consumed. The growing demand for resources has led to increased extraction and use, raising concerns about the environmental impacts and the long-term sustainability of these practices.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that renewable resources are superior to non-renewable resources and should be the sole focus of future development", "B": "To emphasize the importance of natural resources in the global economy and highlight the concerns related to their extraction and use", "C": "To discuss the technological advancements in the extraction and processing of natural resources, and their impact on the environment", "D": "To suggest that the depletion of non-renewable resources will eventually lead to a global economic collapse"}, "explanation": "B: 'To emphasize the importance of natural resources in the global economy and highlight the concerns related to their extraction and use' is the correct answer because the passage discusses the significance of natural resources and raises concerns about the sustainability of current practices.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that renewable resources are superior to non-renewable resources and should be the sole focus of future development' is incorrect because the passage does not make an argument that one type of resource is superior or that only renewable resources should be pursued.", "'To discuss the technological advancements in the extraction and processing of natural resources, and their impact on the environment' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on technological advancements or their environmental impact.", "'To suggest that the depletion of non-renewable resources will eventually lead to a global economic collapse' is incorrect because the passage does not make a prediction about the consequences of resource depletion on the global economy."], "id": 23001}]
