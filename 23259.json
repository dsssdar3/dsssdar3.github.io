In his model, electrons orbit the nucleus in distinct energy levels, and they can move between these levels by absorbing or emitting ______ According to this model, when an electron moves to a higher energy level, it absorbs energy.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "photons' energy", "B": "photons', energy", "C": "photons and such", "D": "photon\u2019s energies"}, "explanation": "A: 'photons' energy' is the correct answer because it correctly uses the plural possessive form of 'photons' to indicate that the energy belongs to multiple photons.", "distractor_explanation": ["'photons and such' is incorrect because it does not convey the appropriate relationship between photons and energy.", "'photons', energy' is incorrect because the comma usage is unnecessary and does not properly indicate possession.", "'photon\u2019s energies' is incorrect because it uses the singular possessive form of 'photon' instead of the required plural possessive form."], "id": 23259}]
