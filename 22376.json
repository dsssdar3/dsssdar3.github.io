[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Deep-sea coral reefs are complex ecosystems that provide habitat for a variety of marine species. These underwater structures are formed by the slow accumulation of calcium carbonate secreted by tiny coral polyps. As the polyps die, their exoskeletons provide the foundation for new colonies. The intricate architecture of the reefs offers protection and food resources for countless organisms, contributing to the overall biodiversity of the ocean.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Deep-sea coral reefs serve as essential ecosystems, providing habitat and resources for various marine species.", "B": "Coral reefs provide a home for many marine species, and their destruction would lead to a significant loss of biodiversity.", "C": "Deep-sea coral reefs are formed primarily by the accumulation of calcium carbonate from coral polyps.", "D": "The process of coral reef formation relies on the continuous growth and death of coral polyps over time."}, "explanation": "A: 'Deep-sea coral reefs serve as essential ecosystems, providing habitat and resources for various marine species.' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the importance of these reefs as habitats and their contribution to biodiversity.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Deep-sea coral reefs are formed primarily by the accumulation of calcium carbonate from coral polyps.' is incorrect because it only addresses the formation process of the reefs, not their role as ecosystems.", "'Coral reefs provide a home for many marine species, and their destruction would lead to a significant loss of biodiversity.' is incorrect because it focuses on the potential consequences of reef destruction, which is not discussed in the passage.", "'The process of coral reef formation relies on the continuous growth and death of coral polyps over time.' is incorrect because it only focuses on the formation process, not the overall importance of the reefs as ecosystems."], "id": 22376}]
