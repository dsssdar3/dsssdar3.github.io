[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "For decades, space exploration has been dominated by government-funded organizations such as NASA and the European Space Agency. These organizations have made significant strides in expanding our knowledge of the cosmos, sending humans to the moon and launching numerous probes and satellites to explore distant planets. _______ in recent years, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have entered the field, aiming to revolutionize space travel and make it more accessible to the public.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "In addition", "B": "Similarly", "C": "However", "D": "Therefore"}, "explanation": "C: 'However' is the correct answer because it provides a contrast between the government-funded organizations that have historically dominated space exploration and the recent entrance of private companies into the field.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the private companies' entrance into the field is similar to the actions of government-funded organizations, when the passage is actually highlighting a contrast.", "'In addition' is incorrect because it suggests that the entrance of private companies is merely another point about government-funded organizations, rather than contrasting their roles in space exploration.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the actions of government-funded organizations and the entrance of private companies, which is not the focus of the passage."], "id": 22531}]
