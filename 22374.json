His work in understanding the nature of gases and their reactions led to the development of modern chemistry. Priestley also made contributions to the fields of electricity and optics, but his most significant impact was in revolutionizing the understanding of the air we breathe and the role of gases in sustaining life.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Joseph Priestley's discovery of oxygen was overshadowed by his contributions to the fields of electricity and optics.", "B": "Joseph Priestley's interest in gases and their reactions was the result of his work in electricity and optics.", "C": "Joseph Priestley's various scientific contributions, especially his discovery of oxygen, greatly influenced modern chemistry.", "D": "Joseph Priestley's work mainly focused on electricity and optics, with some minor contributions to the understanding of gases."}, "explanation": "C: 'Joseph Priestley's various scientific contributions, especially his discovery of oxygen, greatly influenced modern chemistry.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses Priestley's major influence on modern chemistry through his discovery of oxygen and his work in understanding gases.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Joseph Priestley's interest in gases and their reactions was the result of his work in electricity and optics.' is incorrect because the passage does not imply that his work in electricity and optics led to his interest in gases.", "'Joseph Priestley's discovery of oxygen was overshadowed by his contributions to the fields of electricity and optics.' is incorrect because the passage states that his most significant impact was in the discovery of oxygen and gases.", "'Joseph Priestley's work mainly focused on electricity and optics, with some minor contributions to the understanding of gases.' is incorrect because the passage highlights his most significant impact as being the discovery of oxygen and understanding of gases, not electricity and optics."], "id": 22374}]
