[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Pierre-Simon Laplace, a prominent French mathematician and physicist, made significant contributions to the field of probability theory. Laplace's Rule of Succession, a mathematical formula, was developed to predict the likelihood of an event ____ on the basis of its previous occurrences.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "to occur", "B": "occurring", "C": "occur", "D": "that occurs"}, "explanation": "B: 'occurring' is the correct answer because it is consistent with the other present participle verbs used in the passage and it properly completes the sentence to express the purpose of Laplace's Rule of Succession.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to occur' is incorrect because it forms an infinitive verb phrase, which does not fit properly in the sentence's structure.", "'occur' is incorrect because it is a base verb form and does not fit in the sentence's structure.", "'that occurs' is incorrect because it introduces a relative clause, which does not fit within the sentence's structure."], "id": 21165}]
