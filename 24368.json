[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, and astronomer who made numerous contributions to various fields of science. One of his most famous discoveries is the principle of buoyancy, which states that the upward force exerted by a fluid on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. _______ this principle is widely used in the design of ships and submarines.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand,", "B": "Similarly,", "C": "Today,", "D": "In contrast,"}, "explanation": "C: 'Today' is the correct answer because it logically signals that the passage is transitioning from discussing Archimedes' discovery of the principle of buoyancy to its application in modern times.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it suggests that the following sentence offers a similar example or concept, while it actually describes a current application of the principle.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests that the following sentence offers a contrast or alternative, whereas the sentence discusses a current application of the previously mentioned principle.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or difference, when the sentence is actually about a current application of the principle."], "id": 24368}]
