[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "The passage discusses Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist known for formulating Ohm's Law, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. Ohm's work played a significant role in the development of our modern understanding of electricity, and his contributions continue to influence the study and application of electrical engineering.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "An overview of Georg Simon Ohm's contributions to the field of electrical engineering", "B": "A detailed explanation of Ohm's Law and its impact on modern technology", "C": "The life story of Georg Simon Ohm and his journey to become a renowned physicist", "D": "A comparison between Georg Simon Ohm's work and that of other prominent physicists"}, "explanation": "A: 'An overview of Georg Simon Ohm's contributions to the field of electrical engineering' is the correct answer because the passage briefly discusses Ohm's formulation of Ohm's Law and its impact on the development of electrical engineering.", "distractor_explanation": ["'A detailed explanation of Ohm's Law and its impact on modern technology' is incorrect because the passage only provides a brief overview of Ohm's Law and does not delve into its specific details or impact on technology.", "'The life story of Georg Simon Ohm and his journey to become a renowned physicist' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Ohm's personal life or journey.", "'A comparison between Georg Simon Ohm's work and that of other prominent physicists' is incorrect because the passage focuses solely on Ohm's contributions and does not compare his work to that of others."], "id": 23372}]
