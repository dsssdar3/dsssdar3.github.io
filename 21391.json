[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In civil engineering, a cantilever bridge utilizes horizontal beams, called cantilevers, to support the main structure. The cantilevers are anchored only at one end, allowing the bridge to extend over a significant distance without the need for additional supports. This design is particularly useful in areas where it is difficult or expensive to construct piers, such as deep water or environmentally sensitive locations.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "The main purpose of cantilever bridges is to protect environmentally sensitive areas.", "B": "Cantilever bridges are the most common type of bridge in civil engineering.", "C": "Cantilever bridges are less expensive to build than other types of bridges.", "D": "The cantilever bridge design is beneficial for spanning long distances without additional supports."}, "explanation": "D: 'The cantilever bridge design is beneficial for spanning long distances without additional supports' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the design of cantilever bridges and their ability to extend over significant distances without needing extra supports.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Cantilever bridges are the most common type of bridge in civil engineering' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the prevalence of cantilever bridges.", "'Cantilever bridges are less expensive to build than other types of bridges' is incorrect because the passage only states that they are useful in areas where it is difficult or expensive to construct piers, not that they are less expensive overall.", "'The main purpose of cantilever bridges is to protect environmentally sensitive areas' is incorrect because the passage only states that they are particularly useful in such areas, not that it is their main purpose."], "id": 21391}]
