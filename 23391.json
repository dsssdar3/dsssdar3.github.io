[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is often recognized as the world's first computer programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer designed to perform complex calculations. Lovelace's most remarkable contribution was her algorithm, intended to be processed by the machine, which she wrote while translating an article about Babbage's invention. Her visionary ideas about the potential of computing machines went beyond mere number crunching and laid the foundation for modern computer programming.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer due to her work on the Analytical Engine.", "B": "Ada Lovelace's translation skills helped her understand the complexities of Babbage's Analytical Engine.", "C": "Ada Lovelace's collaboration with Charles Babbage resulted in the invention of the Analytical Engine.", "D": "Ada Lovelace's algorithm for the Analytical Engine was solely focused on performing complex calculations."}, "explanation": "A: 'Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer due to her work on the Analytical Engine' is the correct answer because the passage highlights her work on the Analytical Engine and her algorithm's contribution to the foundations of modern computer programming.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Ada Lovelace's collaboration with Charles Babbage resulted in the invention of the Analytical Engine' is incorrect because the passage states that she worked with Babbage on his invention, not that she was responsible for its creation.", "'Ada Lovelace's translation skills helped her understand the complexities of Babbage's Analytical Engine' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on her translation skills but rather on her algorithm and contribution to computer programming.", "'Ada Lovelace's algorithm for the Analytical Engine was solely focused on performing complex calculations' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes her visionary ideas going beyond mere number crunching, laying the foundation for modern computer programming."], "id": 23391}]
