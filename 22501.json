[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Marine engineers often face unique challenges in designing offshore structures, as they have to account for factors like corrosion, fatigue, and environmental forces. By utilizing advanced materials and innovative design techniques, marine engineers can create structures that are able to withstand these forces and maintain their integrity over time. One such innovative design technique is ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "the implementation of advanced communication systems for seamless connectivity with onshore facilities", "B": "the incorporation of solar panels and wind turbines to harness renewable energy", "C": "the addition of recreational facilities and amenities for the occupants of offshore structures", "D": "the use of corrosion-resistant materials and coatings in the construction of offshore structures"}, "explanation": "D: 'the use of corrosion-resistant materials and coatings in the construction of offshore structures' is the correct answer because it directly addresses the challenges mentioned in the passage, such as corrosion and maintaining structural integrity over time.", "distractor_explanation": ["'the incorporation of solar panels and wind turbines to harness renewable energy' is incorrect because it does not address the challenges of corrosion, fatigue, and environmental forces faced by marine engineers.", "'the addition of recreational facilities and amenities for the occupants of offshore structures' is incorrect because it does not relate to the challenges faced by marine engineers when designing structures to withstand environmental forces.", "'the implementation of advanced communication systems for seamless connectivity with onshore facilities' is incorrect because it does not address the challenges of corrosion, fatigue, and environmental forces faced by marine engineers."], "id": 22501}]
