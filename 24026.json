[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the world of software engineering, a popular development approach is called Agile methodology. This approach emphasizes adaptability and collaboration, allowing developers to respond to changing requirements and make adjustments throughout the development process. Agile teams typically work in short iterations called sprints, during which they focus on completing a specific set of tasks. This iterative process allows for continuous feedback, improvement, and adaptation, leading to more efficient software development cycles.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To introduce the Agile methodology and its emphasis on adaptability and collaboration in software development", "B": "To argue that Agile methodology is the only effective approach in software engineering", "C": "To describe the history and origins of Agile methodology and how it has evolved over time", "D": "To compare various software development approaches, including Agile methodology, and their effectiveness"}, "explanation": "A: 'To introduce the Agile methodology and its emphasis on adaptability and collaboration in software development' is the correct answer because the text focuses on presenting the Agile methodology and its key features.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that Agile methodology is the only effective approach in software engineering' is incorrect because the text does not claim Agile is the only effective method, but rather explains its features.", "'To describe the history and origins of Agile methodology and how it has evolved over time' is incorrect because the text does not discuss the history or evolution of Agile methodology.", "'To compare various software development approaches, including Agile methodology, and their effectiveness' is incorrect because the text does not compare Agile methodology with other approaches."], "id": 24026}]
