[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the field of surveying engineering, the development of remote sensing technology has revolutionized the way data is collected and analyzed. Remote sensing devices can gather information about the Earth's surface without direct contact, allowing surveyors to access previously inaccessible areas. This technology has led to more accurate and efficient mapping, monitoring of natural resources, and assessment of environmental conditions. Furthermore, the integration of remote sensing with geographic information systems (GIS) has enhanced the potential for advanced spatial analysis and decision-making in various industries.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To compare different methods of data collection and analysis in the field of surveying engineering", "B": "To discuss the history of surveying engineering and its evolution over time", "C": "To highlight the impact of remote sensing technology on surveying engineering and its applications", "D": "To explore various career opportunities for surveying engineers in the era of remote sensing"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the impact of remote sensing technology on surveying engineering and its applications' is the correct answer because the text focuses on the benefits and advancements brought by remote sensing technology in the field of surveying engineering.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the history of surveying engineering and its evolution over time' is incorrect because the text focuses on the impact of remote sensing technology, not on the history of surveying engineering.", "'To compare different methods of data collection and analysis in the field of surveying engineering' is incorrect because the text mainly discusses the advantages of remote sensing technology and does not compare it with other methods.", "'To explore various career opportunities for surveying engineers in the era of remote sensing' is incorrect because the text does not mention career opportunities or job prospects in the field."], "id": 23039}]
