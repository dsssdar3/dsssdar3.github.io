[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a rapidly growing field in civil engineering that involves the use of sensors and data analysis to evaluate the condition of structures. SHM systems can detect and locate damage in real-time, allowing engineers to take appropriate action before a structure fails. One popular method of SHM is the use of fiber optic sensors, which can be embedded within a structure's material or attached to its surface. _______ some researchers are exploring the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras and sensors to inspect structures from a distance.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Meanwhile,", "B": "Therefore,", "C": "In contrast,", "D": "Similarly,"}, "explanation": "A: 'Meanwhile' is the correct answer because it introduces an alternative method being explored in the field of Structural Health Monitoring, which is different from the fiber optic sensors mentioned in the previous sentences.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Therefore' is incorrect because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two methods, which is not the case.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests that the use of UAVs is a contrasting method to fiber optic sensors, while both are actually methods used for SHM.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the use of UAVs is similar to the use of fiber optic sensors, while they are two different methods."], "id": 22560}]
