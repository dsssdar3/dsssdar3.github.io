The hull shape influences the ship's stability, resistance, and maneuverability in various sea conditions. The challenge for engineers is to optimize the hull design to achieve a balance between these performance factors while also ensuring the ship's structural integrity and meeting industry regulations.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Marine systems engineering focuses solely on the structural integrity of a vessel's hull.", "B": "Hull design has little impact on a ship's performance in different sea conditions.", "C": "The main challenge in marine systems engineering is to comply with industry regulations.", "D": "Optimizing hull design is vital in marine systems engineering to achieve a balance between performance factors."}, "explanation": "D: 'Optimizing hull design is vital in marine systems engineering to achieve a balance between performance factors.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses the importance of hull design in achieving a balance between various performance factors and the challenges engineers face in optimizing it.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Marine systems engineering focuses solely on the structural integrity of a vessel's hull.' is incorrect because the passage states that hull design influences various performance factors, not just structural integrity.", "'Hull design has little impact on a ship's performance in different sea conditions.' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes that hull design is crucial for a ship's stability, resistance, and maneuverability.", "'The main challenge in marine systems engineering is to comply with industry regulations.' is incorrect because the passage states that the challenge for engineers is to optimize hull design while ensuring structural integrity and meeting regulations, not just complying with regulations."], "id": 22387}]
