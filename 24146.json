[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Rhetorical Synthesis", "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: \u2022 Environmental biotechnology is a field that combines biology and technology to address environmental problems. \u2022 Phytoremediation is an environmental biotechnology technique that uses plants to clean up polluted soil and water. \u2022 Poplar trees are a popular choice for phytoremediation due to their fast growth and high tolerance for pollutants. \u2022 Some engineered bacteria can degrade pollutants in water and soil, providing a complementary approach to phytoremediation.", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to describe how environmental biotechnology addresses environmental problems?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Environmental biotechnology uses techniques like phytoremediation with poplar trees and engineered bacteria to clean up polluted soil and water.", "B": "Poplar trees are commonly used in environmental biotechnology due to their pollutant tolerance.", "C": "Environmental biotechnology is a field that helps clean up pollutants by planting trees.", "D": "Phytoremediation is a technique that combines biology and technology to address environmental problems."}, "explanation": "A: 'Environmental biotechnology uses techniques like phytoremediation with poplar trees and engineered bacteria to clean up polluted soil and water.' is the correct answer because it effectively synthesizes information from the notes to describe how environmental biotechnology addresses environmental problems.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Environmental biotechnology is a field that helps clean up pollutants by planting trees.' is incorrect because it oversimplifies the field and does not mention the use of engineered bacteria.", "'Poplar trees are commonly used in environmental biotechnology due to their pollutant tolerance.' is incorrect because it only focuses on one aspect of environmental biotechnology and does not encompass the broader techniques used in the field.", "'Phytoremediation is a technique that combines biology and technology to address environmental problems.' is incorrect because it incorrectly defines phytoremediation as the combination of biology and technology, rather than an application of environmental biotechnology."], "id": 24146}]
