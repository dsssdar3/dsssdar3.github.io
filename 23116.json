This annexation laid the groundwork for the Mexican-American War and further fueled the debate over the expansion of slavery into newly acquired territories.", "text_2": "The Texas Annexation can also be viewed as a manifestation of the concept of Manifest Destiny, which held that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that the annexation of Texas was a natural and inevitable part of the nation's growth, while opponents argued that it was an aggressive land grab that would lead to conflict."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the advocates of Manifest Destiny (Text 2) most likely respond to the controversy over the expansion of slavery discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By pointing out that the annexation of Texas was an isolated event and not part of a larger expansionist strategy", "B": "By emphasizing the economic benefits that the annexation of Texas brought to the United States, downplaying the issue of slavery", "C": "By asserting that the expansion of the United States, including the annexation of Texas, was predestined and inevitable, regardless of the slavery issue", "D": "By claiming that the controversy over the expansion of slavery was a minor issue compared to the overall importance of the nation's growth"}, "explanation": "C: 'By asserting that the expansion of the United States, including the annexation of Texas, was predestined and inevitable, regardless of the slavery issue' is the correct answer because the advocates of Manifest Destiny in Text 2 believed that the nation's growth was inevitable and natural, which implies that they would likely see the slavery issue as a secondary concern.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By pointing out that the annexation of Texas was an isolated event and not part of a larger expansionist strategy' is incorrect because Manifest Destiny was a broader concept advocating for the expansion of the United States.", "'By emphasizing the economic benefits that the annexation of Texas brought to the United States, downplaying the issue of slavery' is incorrect because the economic benefits are not mentioned in Text 2.", "'By claiming that the controversy over the expansion of slavery was a minor issue compared to the overall importance of the nation's growth' is incorrect because it does not capture the inevitability aspect emphasized by Manifest Destiny."], "id": 23116}]
