In 1742, Celsius proposed a temperature scale with 100 divisions, where 0 represented the boiling point of water and 100 represented the freezing point. However, this scale was later ______ and now has 0 as the freezing point and 100 as the boiling point.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "reversed", "B": "disregarded", "C": "duplicated", "D": "expanded"}, "explanation": "A: 'reversed' is the correct answer because it accurately describes how the Celsius scale was changed, with the boiling point and freezing point switching places.", "distractor_explanation": ["'disregarded' is incorrect because the Celsius scale was not disregarded, but rather modified.", "'duplicated' is incorrect because the Celsius scale was not duplicated, but changed.", "'expanded' is incorrect because the scale still has 100 divisions, only the boiling and freezing points positions were changed."], "id": 24199}]
