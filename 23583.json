[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Johannes Kepler, a key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, is best known for his laws of planetary motion. These laws describe the motion of planets around the sun in elliptical orbits. Kepler's discoveries revolutionized our understanding of the solar system, providing a more accurate model than the previously accepted geocentric model. _______ Kepler also made significant contributions to the fields of optics and mathematics.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Furthermore", "B": "In contrast", "C": "However", "D": "On the other hand"}, "explanation": "A: 'Furthermore' is the correct answer because it indicates that the information about Kepler's contributions to optics and mathematics adds to the previous information about his laws of planetary motion.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it illogically suggests that Kepler's contributions to optics and mathematics are contrasting ideas to his laws of planetary motion.", "'However' is incorrect because it illogically implies that there is a contrast between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his contributions to optics and mathematics.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative or contrast between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his contributions to optics and mathematics, which is not the case."], "id": 23583}]
