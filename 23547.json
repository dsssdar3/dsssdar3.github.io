[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Swarm robotics is an emerging field that focuses on the design and implementation of large groups of relatively simple robots that can work together to accomplish complex tasks. These robots can communicate and cooperate with one another, allowing them to adapt and respond to changing environments. _______ while individual robots may have limited capabilities, the collective intelligence of the swarm allows it to overcome obstacles and achieve its objectives.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "In contrast,", "B": "Alternatively,", "C": "Nevertheless,", "D": "Interestingly,"}, "explanation": "D: 'Interestingly' is the correct answer because it introduces a surprising fact about swarm robotics that adds to the information provided in the previous sentences.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative to the concept discussed in the previous sentences, which is not the case.", "'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it indicates a contrast or exception to the previous sentences, which is not present in the context.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it indicates a contrast or difference between the statements, which is not the purpose of the sentence."], "id": 23547}]
