[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Statue of Liberty, a symbol of freedom and democracy, was a gift from France to the United States. Its designer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, intended for the statue's torch to symbolize enlightenment, guiding the world towards liberty.", "text_2": "The statue's torch underwent a significant restoration in 1984. This process replaced the original torch, made of copper and glass, with a new gold leaf-covered version.
