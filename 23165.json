[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "In robotics engineering, a critical component called the controller ensures a robot's smooth functioning. The controller acts as a bridge between the robot's hardware and software, allowing them to communicate effectively. To achieve this, the controller ______ a series of algorithms that translate the robot's movements into commands.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "entering", "B": "implements", "C": "entered", "D": "has implemented"}, "explanation": "B: 'implements' is the correct answer because it provides the appropriate present tense verb to describe the controller's continuous action in the given context.", "distractor_explanation": ["'entering' is incorrect because it uses a nonfinite participle instead of a finite verb.", "'entered' is incorrect because it uses the past tense verb, which is not consistent with the present tense context of the passage.", "'has implemented' is incorrect because the present perfect tense doesn't convey the ongoing nature of the controller's action."], "id": 23165}]
