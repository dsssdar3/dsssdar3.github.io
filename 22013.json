[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In recent years, robotics engineering has made significant advancements in the development of soft robots. These robots are made from flexible materials that mimic organic structures, allowing them to perform tasks in a more versatile and adaptable manner compared to traditional rigid robots. Soft robots have the potential to revolutionize fields such as search and rescue, medical procedures, and agriculture, as they can navigate complex environments and interact safely with humans and delicate objects.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue about the ethical implications of using soft robots in search and rescue operations", "B": "To discuss the history of robotics engineering and the development of different robot types", "C": "To highlight the advancements in soft robotics and their potential impact on various fields", "D": "To compare the efficiency of soft robots with traditional rigid robots in medical procedures"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the advancements in soft robotics and their potential impact on various fields' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the development of soft robots, their unique characteristics, and how they can revolutionize fields such as search and rescue, medical procedures, and agriculture.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the history of robotics engineering and the development of different robot types' is incorrect because the passage focuses specifically on soft robots and their potential applications, rather than providing a historical overview of robotics engineering.", "'To argue about the ethical implications of using soft robots in search and rescue operations' is incorrect because the passage does not address any ethical concerns or arguments.", "'To compare the efficiency of soft robots with traditional rigid robots in medical procedures' is incorrect because, while the passage briefly mentions medical procedures as a potential application for soft robots, it does not specifically compare their efficiency with traditional rigid robots."], "id": 22013}]
