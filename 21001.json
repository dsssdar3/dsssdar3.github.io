[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Marginal revenue refers to the additional income generated from selling one more unit of a good or service. It plays a crucial role in determining the optimal level of production for a firm, as it helps to maximize profit. When marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, it is profitable for a firm to increase production. However, if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, the firm should decrease production to avoid losses. Firms typically aim to produce at a level where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the history of marginal revenue and its development as a core economic principle", "B": "To argue that maximizing marginal revenue should be the primary goal of any firm", "C": "To provide a comprehensive analysis of various cost structures and their impact on marginal revenue", "D": "To explain the concept of marginal revenue and its significance in determining a firm's optimal production level"}, "explanation": "D: 'To explain the concept of marginal revenue and its significance in determining a firm's optimal production level' is the correct answer because the passage defines marginal revenue, explains its role in profit maximization, and describes its relationship with marginal cost.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that maximizing marginal revenue should be the primary goal of any firm' is incorrect because the passage focuses on explaining the concept of marginal revenue and its role in determining optimal production, not arguing for its primacy as a goal.", "'To provide a comprehensive analysis of various cost structures and their impact on marginal revenue' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions marginal cost and does not delve into various cost structures.", "'To discuss the history of marginal revenue and its development as a core economic principle' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the history or development of marginal revenue."], "id": 21001}]
