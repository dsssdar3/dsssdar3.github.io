[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "CRISPR technology has revolutionized genetic editing due to its precision and ease of use. As a result, scientists can now modify genes to eliminate genetic diseases, improve crop yield, and even revive extinct species. However, ethical concerns have arisen regarding its potential misuse, such as the creation of designer babies or the exacerbation of existing inequalities. Despite these concerns, CRISPR continues to drive advancements in various scientific fields and spark debates on its applications.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue for the unrestricted use of CRISPR technology in scientific research and development", "B": "To discuss the revolutionary impact of CRISPR technology on genetic editing while acknowledging ethical concerns", "C": "To provide an in-depth analysis of the ethical issues surrounding the use of CRISPR technology", "D": "To focus on the potential negative consequences of CRISPR technology and discourage its use"}, "explanation": "B: 'To discuss the revolutionary impact of CRISPR technology on genetic editing while acknowledging ethical concerns' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main point of the passage: the transformative effect of CRISPR on various scientific fields, along with the ethical issues that have arisen.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue for the unrestricted use of CRISPR technology in scientific research and development' is incorrect because the passage acknowledges ethical concerns and does not advocate for unrestricted use.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of the ethical issues surrounding the use of CRISPR technology' is incorrect because the passage discusses both the positive impacts and ethical concerns, not just an in-depth analysis of ethical issues.", "'To focus on the potential negative consequences of CRISPR technology and discourage its use' is incorrect because the passage also highlights the positive aspects of CRISPR technology, not simply focusing on its negative consequences."], "id": 21043}]
