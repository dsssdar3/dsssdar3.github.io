[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Quantum cryptography, a technique that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, provides secure communication by encoding messages into quantum states. The encoded information is then transmitted through a process called quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD networks are considered unconditionally secure because any attempt to ______ the transmission results in the alteration of the message.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "intercepting", "B": "intercept", "C": "to intercept", "D": "have intercepted"}, "explanation": "B: 'intercept' is the correct answer because it provides the main clause with the finite present tense verb needed to indicate the action of a third party on the transmission.", "distractor_explanation": ["'intercepting' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle does not supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'to intercept' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive does not supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'have intercepted' is incorrect because the present perfect verb does not fit the context of the sentence."], "id": 22117}]
