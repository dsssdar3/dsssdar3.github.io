[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Hydroponics, the process of growing plants without soil, has gained popularity for its ability to save water and space. Research indicates that hydroponic systems use up to 90% less water than traditional soil-based agriculture, making it an ideal solution for water-scarce regions. Moreover, hydroponics allows for vertical farming, which can greatly increase crop yield per unit area. Consequently, the adoption of hydroponic systems may contribute to______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "a significant reduction in the need for pesticides and herbicides, as pests are less likely to infest hydroponic systems", "B": "a decrease in the demand for soil amendments and fertilizers in traditional agriculture", "C": "the sustainable intensification of agriculture in regions where water and space are major concerns", "D": "a major shift in agricultural practices worldwide, with traditional soil-based agriculture becoming obsolete"}, "explanation": "C: 'the sustainable intensification of agriculture in regions where water and space are major concerns' is the correct answer because the passage highlights the benefits of hydroponics in saving water and space, making it ideal for sustainable intensification in regions with such concerns.", "distractor_explanation": ["'a decrease in the demand for soil amendments and fertilizers in traditional agriculture' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the impact of hydroponics on traditional agriculture's demand for soil amendments and fertilizers.", "'a significant reduction in the need for pesticides and herbicides, as pests are less likely to infest hydroponic systems' is incorrect because the passage does not mention pest control or the need for pesticides and herbicides in hydroponic systems.", "'a major shift in agricultural practices worldwide, with traditional soil-based agriculture becoming obsolete' is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that hydroponics will replace traditional agriculture entirely, only that it can contribute to sustainable intensification in certain regions."], "id": 23503}]
