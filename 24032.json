[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Augustin-Louis Cauchy, a renowned French mathematician, contributed significantly to the development of modern mathematics. His work covered a vast range of topics, including calculus, complex analysis, and continuum mechanics. Cauchy's rigorous approach to mathematical proofs set a new standard in the field, enhancing the precision and clarity of mathematical research. In addition, his contributions to the wave theory of light and the study of elasticity advanced these areas of science.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To highlight Augustin-Louis Cauchy's profound impact on various fields of mathematics and science", "B": "To discuss Augustin-Louis Cauchy's personal journey in becoming a renowned mathematician", "C": "To argue that Augustin-Louis Cauchy's work has been largely overshadowed by other mathematicians", "D": "To provide a detailed account of Augustin-Louis Cauchy's contributions to the wave theory of light"}, "explanation": "A: 'To highlight Augustin-Louis Cauchy's profound impact on various fields of mathematics and science' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Cauchy's significant contributions to different areas of mathematics and science, including calculus, complex analysis, continuum mechanics, the wave theory of light, and the study of elasticity.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss Augustin-Louis Cauchy's personal journey in becoming a renowned mathematician' is incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about Cauchy's personal life or his path to becoming a mathematician.", "'To argue that Augustin-Louis Cauchy's work has been largely overshadowed by other mathematicians' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any comparison with other mathematicians or suggest that Cauchy's work is overshadowed.", "'To provide a detailed account of Augustin-Louis Cauchy's contributions to the wave theory of light' is incorrect because, although the passage mentions his contributions to the wave theory of light, it is not the main focus of the text."], "id": 24032}]
