[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Quantum computing, a relatively new field in computer science, harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to enable calculations at immensely greater speed and capacity than classical computers. Traditional computers rely on bits, which represent either a 0 or a 1, to perform tasks. _______ quantum computers use qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to a phenomenon known as superposition.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "For example,", "B": "Similarly,", "C": "Furthermore,", "D": "In contrast,"}, "explanation": "D: 'In contrast' is the correct answer because it highlights the difference between traditional computers using bits and quantum computers using qubits.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it would imply that quantum computers use bits in the same way as traditional computers, which is not the case.", "'Furthermore' is incorrect because it would suggest that the information about qubits is an extension of the information about bits, rather than a contrast.", "'For example' is incorrect because it would imply that qubits are an example of how traditional computers perform tasks, which is not accurate."], "id": 24380}]
