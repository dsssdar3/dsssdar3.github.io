[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Lunar exploration has long been a topic of interest for scientists and engineers. Researchers, such as Dr. Margaret Chen, have been investigating the potential benefits of establishing a permanent lunar base for future space missions. Dr. Chen's team believes that the lunar surface's abundance of resources, such as water, could support a sustainable habitat for astronauts.", "text_2": "In a recent study, Dr. Richard Adler and his colleagues challenged the feasibility of a permanent lunar base, citing the harsh environmental conditions on the moon as a major obstacle. They argue that the extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation exposure on the lunar surface would pose severe challenges for astronauts and the equipment needed to maintain a base."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Richard Adler and colleagues in Text 2 most likely respond to the benefits of establishing a permanent lunar base discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that the potential benefits of a lunar base are exaggerated and not supported by current research", "B": "By agreeing with the benefits but emphasizing the importance of further technological developments before implementation", "C": "By acknowledging the potential benefits but arguing that the harsh environmental conditions pose significant challenges", "D": "By claiming that the resources needed to establish a lunar base would outweigh any potential benefits derived from the endeavor"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging the potential benefits but arguing that the harsh environmental conditions pose significant challenges' is the correct answer because Text 2 specifically mentions the extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation exposure as obstacles, despite the potential benefits discussed in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By suggesting that the potential benefits of a lunar base are exaggerated and not supported by current research' is incorrect because Text 2 does not question the potential benefits but focuses on the challenges.", "'By agreeing with the benefits but emphasizing the importance of further technological developments before implementation' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention the need for additional technology, but rather highlights the environmental challenges.", "'By claiming that the resources needed to establish a lunar base would outweigh any potential benefits derived from the endeavor' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the challenges posed by the lunar environment, not the resources needed to establish a base."], "id": 21117}]
