[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Historian Jane Thompson explores the immediate economic impact of the September 11 attacks on the United States. She highlights how the financial markets reacted with a significant downturn and numerous businesses faced losses as a result of the attacks. Thompson argues that the economy was able to rebound relatively quickly due to government intervention, and the resilience of the American people.", "text_2": "Economist David Anderson examines the long-term consequences of the September 11 attacks on the global economy. He claims that the attacks led to a heightened sense of insecurity and increased military spending, which in turn contributed to a rise in national debt and a shift in global economic power.
