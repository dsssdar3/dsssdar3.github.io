[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In control engineering, the primary goal is to design a system that maintains stability while responding to changes in its environment. This involves analyzing system models, applying control theory, and designing control mechanisms that minimize error and ensure optimal performance. Engineers must consider factors such as noise, disturbances, and uncertainties when developing control systems to ensure that they operate effectively even in unpredictable conditions.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Control engineering focuses on designing stable systems that effectively respond to environmental changes.", "B": "Control engineering is exclusively concerned with minimizing errors in system models and control mechanisms.", "C": "The primary goal of control engineering is to eliminate noise, disturbances, and uncertainties from control systems.", "D": "Control engineering relies solely on control theory to design control mechanisms for optimal performance."}, "explanation": "A: 'Control engineering focuses on designing stable systems that effectively respond to environmental changes.' is the correct answer because it accurately captures the main idea of the text, which is about creating stable systems that can adapt to changes in their environment.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Control engineering is exclusively concerned with minimizing errors in system models and control mechanisms.' is incorrect because, while error minimization is important, the text also discusses other factors such as noise, disturbances, and uncertainties.", "'The primary goal of control engineering is to eliminate noise, disturbances, and uncertainties from control systems.' is incorrect because the goal is to design systems that can effectively operate despite these factors, not to eliminate them.", "'Control engineering relies solely on control theory to design control mechanisms for optimal performance.' is incorrect because the text mentions other aspects of control engineering, such as analyzing system models and considering various factors."], "id": 23395}]
