[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Andrew Wiles, a British mathematician, made history by solving Fermat's Last Theorem in 1994, a centuries-old unsolved mathematical problem. Wiles' dedication to the theorem was unwavering, as he spent seven years of his life working in isolation on the proof. His perseverance paid off, and Wiles was awarded the Abel Prize in 2016, recognizing his exceptional contribution to the field of mathematics.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Andrew Wiles' solution of Fermat's Last Theorem was controversial and faced significant opposition from the mathematical community.", "B": "Andrew Wiles' dedication and perseverance led to his groundbreaking solution of Fermat's Last Theorem and recognition through the Abel Prize.", "C": "Andrew Wiles was motivated to solve Fermat's Last Theorem purely for financial gain and the fame it would bring him.", "D": "Andrew Wiles' work on Fermat's Last Theorem was a collaborative effort with many mathematicians contributing to the final solution."}, "explanation": "B: 'Andrew Wiles' dedication and perseverance led to his groundbreaking solution of Fermat's Last Theorem and recognition through the Abel Prize.' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Wiles' unwavering dedication, his years of work on the problem, and the recognition he received with the Abel Prize.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Andrew Wiles' solution of Fermat's Last Theorem was controversial and faced significant opposition from the mathematical community.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any controversy or opposition.", "'Andrew Wiles was motivated to solve Fermat's Last Theorem purely for financial gain and the fame it would bring him.' is incorrect because the passage does not address Wiles' motives for solving the theorem.", "'Andrew Wiles' work on Fermat's Last Theorem was a collaborative effort with many mathematicians contributing to the final solution.' is incorrect because the passage specifically states that Wiles worked in isolation for seven years."], "id": 22401}]
