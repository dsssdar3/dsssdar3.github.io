Proponents of higher corporate taxes argue that it is essential for generating government revenue, funding public services, and reducing income inequality. On the other hand, opponents claim that lower corporate taxes are crucial for promoting economic growth, stimulating job creation, and encouraging investments. As countries worldwide grapple with these competing priorities, they must carefully consider the potential consequences of their decisions on their economies and citizens.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To provide an in-depth analysis of the economic consequences of different corporate tax rates", "B": "To emphasize the importance of higher corporate taxes in reducing income inequality", "C": "To advocate for the necessity of lowering corporate taxes to stimulate economic growth", "D": "To explore the contrasting perspectives on corporate tax policies and their implications"}, "explanation": "D: 'To explore the contrasting perspectives on corporate tax policies and their implications' is the correct answer because the passage outlines both the arguments for higher corporate taxes and those for lower corporate taxes, highlighting the competing priorities countries must consider.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To emphasize the importance of higher corporate taxes in reducing income inequality' is incorrect because, although this point is mentioned, the passage also discusses other perspectives on corporate taxes.", "'To advocate for the necessity of lowering corporate taxes to stimulate economic growth' is incorrect because the passage does not advocate a specific viewpoint; instead, it presents both sides of the debate.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of the economic consequences of different corporate tax rates' is incorrect because the passage briefly introduces the debate around corporate tax policies without delving into a detailed analysis of their consequences."], "id": 22016}]
