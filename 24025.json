[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the field of Geospatial Engineering, remote sensing plays a pivotal role in collecting spatial data of the Earth's surface. Using satellites, aerial photography, and other sensing devices, geospatial engineers can monitor and analyze changes in the environment, such as deforestation, climate change, and urban expansion. This information is crucial for decision-makers to develop sustainable policies, manage natural resources, and monitor the effects of human activities on the environment.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To explain the significance of remote sensing in Geospatial Engineering and its applications in environmental monitoring", "B": "To describe the process of collecting data using remote sensing devices in Geospatial Engineering", "C": "To highlight the role of satellites and aerial photography in Geospatial Engineering", "D": "To discuss the career opportunities for geospatial engineers in the field of remote sensing"}, "explanation": "A: 'To explain the significance of remote sensing in Geospatial Engineering and its applications in environmental monitoring' is the correct answer because the text focuses on the importance of remote sensing in collecting spatial data and its relevance to environmental monitoring and decision-making.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To describe the process of collecting data using remote sensing devices in Geospatial Engineering' is incorrect because the text does not provide a detailed description of the data collection process.", "'To highlight the role of satellites and aerial photography in Geospatial Engineering' is incorrect because the text mentions these technologies as examples, but the main purpose is to explain the significance of remote sensing in the field.", "'To discuss the career opportunities for geospatial engineers in the field of remote sensing' is incorrect because the text does not mention any career-related information."], "id": 24025}]
