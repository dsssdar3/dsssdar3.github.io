[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engineering, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has risen to prominence as an alternative to traditional approaches such as the Navier-Stokes equations. The LBM is based on the Boltzmann equation and simulates the motion of particles within a fluid. This method is particularly effective in modeling complex flow phenomena, such as multiphase flows and turbulent flows, due to its ability to handle a wide range of length and time scales.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To compare the advantages and disadvantages of various computational fluid dynamics methods", "B": "To provide an in-depth explanation of the mathematical foundation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method", "C": "To highlight the Lattice Boltzmann Method as an alternative approach in computational fluid dynamics engineering", "D": "To discuss the historical development of computational fluid dynamics engineering and its pioneers"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the Lattice Boltzmann Method as an alternative approach in computational fluid dynamics engineering' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the prominence of the LBM as an alternative to traditional approaches and its effectiveness in modeling complex flow phenomena.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide an in-depth explanation of the mathematical foundation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions that the LBM is based on the Boltzmann equation, without going into detail about the mathematics.", "'To compare the advantages and disadvantages of various computational fluid dynamics methods' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the LBM and does not compare it with other methods.", "'To discuss the historical development of computational fluid dynamics engineering and its pioneers' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the LBM as an alternative approach rather than the history of CFD engineering."], "id": 23000}]
