[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Economist Sarah Mitchell and colleagues observed the relationship between supply and demand in the housing market. They found that high demand for housing, coupled with limited supply, led to increased housing prices. Their study suggests that the primary factor influencing housing prices is the scarcity of available homes in high-demand areas.", "text_2": "In contrast, economist James Peterson and his research team argue that factors beyond supply and demand, such as government regulations and interest rates, play a more significant role in determining housing prices.
