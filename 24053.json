[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Adrienne Rich, a prominent American poet, essayist, and feminist, was known for her politically charged works in the twentieth century. Her poetry often explored themes of social justice, women's rights, and the personal experiences of women in a male-dominated society. Rich's writing style evolved over time, moving from formal and traditional structures to more experimental and free-flowing forms as she became more involved in feminist activism.", "text_2": "In her influential essay 'Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,' Adrienne Rich argued that heterosexuality was not a natural or inherent preference for women but rather a societal construct imposed on them. She claimed that by perpetuating the notion that heterosexual relationships are the norm, society effectively oppresses and marginalizes women, particularly those who identify as lesbian or bisexual."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the evolution of Rich's writing style discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By asserting that Rich's experimentation with form was unrelated to her feminist activism and merely reflected her artistic growth", "B": "By arguing that Rich's earlier works were more effective in conveying her political messages due to their traditional structures", "C": "By suggesting that the shift in Rich's writing style reflects her growing awareness of societal constructs that oppress women", "D": "By claiming that Rich's later works lost their impact because they focused too much on personal experiences rather than broader issues"}, "explanation": "C: 'By suggesting that the shift in Rich's writing style reflects her growing awareness of societal constructs that oppress women' is the correct answer because Text 1 discusses how Rich's writing style evolved as she became more involved in feminist activism, while Text 2 highlights her critique of societal constructs that marginalize women.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that Rich's earlier works were more effective in conveying her political messages due to their traditional structures' is incorrect because neither text suggests that her earlier works were more effective.", "'By asserting that Rich's experimentation with form was unrelated to her feminist activism and merely reflected her artistic growth' is incorrect because Text 1 explicitly mentions her writing style evolved as she became more involved in feminist activism.", "'By claiming that Rich's later works lost their impact because they focused too much on personal experiences rather than broader issues' is incorrect because neither text discusses the impact of her later works in comparison to her earlier works."], "id": 24053}]
