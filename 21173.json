[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Hydroponics, a method of growing plants without soil, relies on nutrient-rich water solutions to provide essential minerals. In a typical hydroponic setup, plants' roots are suspended in the solution, allowing them to ______ the nutrients directly from the water. This method often results in faster growth and higher yields than traditional soil-based cultivation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "absorbing", "B": "to absorb", "C": "absorb", "D": "had absorbed"}, "explanation": "C: 'absorb' is the correct answer because it provides the main clause with a finite present tense verb to indicate the action of the plants' roots in the hydroponic setup.", "distractor_explanation": ["'absorbing' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'to absorb' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'had absorbed' is incorrect because the past perfect tense verb isn't consistent with the present tense verbs used to describe the hydroponic setup."], "id": 21173}]
