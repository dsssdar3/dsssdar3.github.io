[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist, was known for his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in simple terms. In 1964, he delivered a series of lectures at Cornell University, which were later published as 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics.' These lectures became a cornerstone of physics education, making advanced concepts accessible to a wider audience. Feynman's unique teaching methods, which combined humor and storytelling, inspired generations of students to pursue careers in science.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To emphasize Richard Feynman's significant contribution to physics education through his unique teaching methods", "B": "To provide a detailed account of the specific scientific concepts covered in 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics'", "C": "To analyze the humor and storytelling techniques employed by Richard Feynman in his lectures", "D": "To discuss the various institutions where Richard Feynman delivered his famous physics lectures"}, "explanation": "A: 'To emphasize Richard Feynman's significant contribution to physics education through his unique teaching methods' is the correct answer because the text primarily focuses on the impact of Feynman's lectures on making complex scientific concepts accessible.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a detailed account of the specific scientific concepts covered in 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics'' is incorrect because the text does not delve into the specific topics covered in the lectures.", "'To analyze the humor and storytelling techniques employed by Richard Feynman in his lectures' is incorrect because although the text mentions Feynman's use of humor and storytelling, it does not analyze these techniques.", "'To discuss the various institutions where Richard Feynman delivered his famous physics lectures' is incorrect because the text only mentions Cornell University and focuses more on the impact of his lectures."], "id": 21047}]
