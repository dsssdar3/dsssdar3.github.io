[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Joseph Priestley, an 18th-century chemist and theologian, is best known for his discovery of oxygen in 1774. His work laid the foundation for modern chemistry and our understanding of the composition of air. _______ Priestley's contributions extend beyond the realm of science, as he was also a prominent political theorist and clergyman who advocated for religious tolerance and freedom of speech.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "However", "B": "Moreover", "C": "On the other hand", "D": "Alternatively"}, "explanation": "B: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it logically connects Priestley's contributions to both science and other fields, emphasizing the breadth of his work.", "distractor_explanation": ["'However' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or exception to Priestley's contributions in science, which is not the case.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between his scientific work and his other contributions, rather than emphasizing their coexistence.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative option or possibility, rather than connecting Priestley's scientific and other contributions."], "id": 24382}]
