[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the realm of software engineering, the Agile methodology emerged as a response to traditional, rigid project management approaches. Agile emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress, allowing software teams to adapt more quickly to changing requirements. Teams following Agile practices often break projects into smaller, manageable tasks called sprints, which last for a fixed period. This approach enables constant feedback and improvement, ultimately leading to a more efficient development process.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To provide a detailed examination of Agile practices, such as sprint planning, and their implementation", "B": "To argue that traditional project management approaches are no longer relevant in the software industry", "C": "To explain the Agile methodology's key principles and its advantages in software engineering", "D": "To discuss the history of Agile methodology and its influence on the evolution of software engineering"}, "explanation": "C: 'To explain the Agile methodology's key principles and its advantages in software engineering' is the correct answer because the text discusses the Agile methodology's emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress, and how it allows for more efficient development.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that traditional project management approaches are no longer relevant in the software industry' is incorrect because, while the text mentions that Agile emerged as a response to traditional approaches, it doesn't argue that traditional approaches are entirely irrelevant.", "'To provide a detailed examination of Agile practices, such as sprint planning, and their implementation' is incorrect because the text only briefly mentions sprints as an example of Agile practices, rather than providing a detailed examination.", "'To discuss the history of Agile methodology and its influence on the evolution of software engineering' is incorrect because the text focuses on the key principles of Agile methodology and its advantages, rather than its history or influence on software engineering."], "id": 22010}]
