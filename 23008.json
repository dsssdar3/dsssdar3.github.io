[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Max Planck, a German physicist, made groundbreaking contributions to the field of quantum mechanics. In 1900, he discovered that energy is quantized, meaning it comes in discrete packets called quanta. This discovery was a significant departure from classical physics, which viewed energy as continuous. Planck's discovery paved the way for many essential developments in the field, including the work of Einstein and Bohr.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To compare and contrast the various contributions of Planck, Einstein, and Bohr to the field of physics", "B": "To provide an in-depth analysis of the differences between classical physics and quantum mechanics", "C": "To explore the personal life and struggles of Max Planck as a scientist during his time", "D": "To briefly discuss Max Planck's discovery of energy quantization and its impact on the field of physics"}, "explanation": "D: 'To briefly discuss Max Planck's discovery of energy quantization and its impact on the field of physics' is the correct answer because the text focuses on Planck's discovery and how it led to essential developments in the field.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide an in-depth analysis of the differences between classical physics and quantum mechanics' is incorrect because the text only briefly mentions the difference between classical physics and quantum mechanics.", "'To explore the personal life and struggles of Max Planck as a scientist during his time' is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about Planck's personal life.", "'To compare and contrast the various contributions of Planck, Einstein, and Bohr to the field of physics' is incorrect because the text only briefly mentions Einstein and Bohr's work, rather than comparing their contributions to Planck's."], "id": 23008}]
