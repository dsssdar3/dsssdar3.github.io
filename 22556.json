[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Tower Bridge, an iconic symbol of London, was completed in 1894, spanning the River Thames. It was designed with a unique feature: a drawbridge that could be raised in less than a minute to allow ships to pass. Since it was opened, the bridge has been raised over 1,000 times per year on average. _______ it has only failed to open on a handful of occasions, primarily due to mechanical or electrical issues.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "In contrast,", "B": "Similarly,", "C": "Alternatively,", "D": "Remarkably,"}, "explanation": "D: 'Remarkably' is the correct answer because it emphasizes the impressive nature of the bridge's reliability despite its frequent usage.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it does not provide a logical connection or comparison to the information about the bridge's average usage.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it does not provide a contrasting option or possibility.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it does not provide a contrasting detail or point in comparison to the previous information."], "id": 22556}]
