[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Nathaniel Hawthorne, a prominent American author, was born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1804. His works often focused on themes of sin, guilt, and morality, which were influenced by the Puritan heritage of his hometown. For instance, his novel The Scarlet Letter delves into the moral consequences of adultery in a Puritan society. _______ his short story Young Goodman Brown explores the struggle between good and evil in the human soul.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "Alternatively", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "On the other hand"}, "explanation": "A: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it logically connects the two examples of Hawthorne's works, both of which explore themes of morality and human nature.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests that the examples are contrasting or offer different perspectives, while they both illustrate the same themes.", "'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or exception to the previous statement, which is not the case as both examples explore similar themes.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between the two examples, whereas they both address themes of morality and human nature."], "id": 23572}]
