[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Command of Evidence", "passage": "Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician, made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, and continued fractions. Despite his lack of formal education, he gained recognition for his work by mathematicians worldwide. However, Ramanujan faced numerous obstacles, including limited resources and social stigma, which hindered his progress.", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the claim that Ramanujan's work was recognized by mathematicians worldwide despite his limited resources and social stigma?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Ramanujan's work was published in several international mathematical journals and praised by prominent mathematicians.", "B": "Ramanujan was known for his ability to solve complex mathematical problems without the use of traditional methods.", "C": "Ramanujan's work was often shared among his friends, who were also self-taught mathematicians in India.", "D": "Ramanujan was able to overcome various health issues and continue working on his mathematical theories."}, "explanation": "A: 'Ramanujan's work was published in several international mathematical journals and praised by prominent mathematicians' is the correct answer because it directly supports the claim that Ramanujan's work was recognized worldwide despite his challenges.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Ramanujan was known for his ability to solve complex mathematical problems without the use of traditional methods' is incorrect because it does not address the recognition of his work by mathematicians worldwide.", "'Ramanujan's work was often shared among his friends, who were also self-taught mathematicians in India' is incorrect because it only focuses on local recognition, not the worldwide recognition claimed in the passage.", "'Ramanujan was able to overcome various health issues and continue working on his mathematical theories' is incorrect because it does not address the recognition of his work by mathematicians worldwide."], "id": 23424}]
