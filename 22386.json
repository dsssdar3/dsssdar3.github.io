[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In the field of mechatronics engineering, the integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering is essential. This interdisciplinary approach allows engineers to design complex systems that require expertise in multiple areas. Mechatronics engineers often work on projects such as robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing systems. Their unique skill set enables them to address challenges in these fields more effectively than engineers who specialize in a single discipline.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Mechatronics engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to solve complex problems.", "B": "Mechatronics engineering primarily focuses on the design of robotics and automation systems.", "C": "Mechatronics engineers are less effective at addressing challenges in their field than engineers who specialize in a single discipline.", "D": "Mechatronics engineering is a relatively new field that has yet to gain widespread recognition in the engineering community."}, "explanation": "A: 'Mechatronics engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to solve complex problems.' is the correct answer because the passage emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of mechatronics engineering and how it allows engineers to design complex systems.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Mechatronics engineering primarily focuses on the design of robotics and automation systems.' is incorrect because, although the passage mentions robotics and automation as examples of projects mechatronics engineers might work on, it does not limit the field to just these areas.", "'Mechatronics engineers are less effective at addressing challenges in their field than engineers who specialize in a single discipline.' is incorrect because the passage actually states that their unique skill set enables them to address challenges more effectively than engineers who specialize in a single discipline.", "'Mechatronics engineering is a relatively new field that has yet to gain widespread recognition in the engineering community.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the age or recognition of the field within the engineering community."], "id": 22386}]
