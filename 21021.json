[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Medical imaging has revolutionized the field of medicine by enabling doctors to visualize the internal structures of a patient's body noninvasively. Techniques such as X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans have become indispensable diagnostic tools. While these imaging procedures have significantly improved patient outcomes and reduced the need for exploratory surgery, they also present potential risks, including exposure to ionizing radiation and potential allergic reactions to contrast agents.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To provide a comprehensive overview of the history and development of various medical imaging technologies", "B": "To argue that medical imaging techniques are the sole reason for the decline in exploratory surgeries worldwide", "C": "To highlight the importance of medical imaging techniques in modern medicine and acknowledge their potential risks", "D": "To compare the effectiveness of different medical imaging techniques in diagnosing specific medical conditions"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the importance of medical imaging techniques in modern medicine and acknowledge their potential risks' is the correct answer because the passage explains the significance of various imaging techniques in medicine and briefly mentions the risks associated with them.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that medical imaging techniques are the sole reason for the decline in exploratory surgeries worldwide' is incorrect because the passage does not claim that medical imaging is the only reason for the decline in exploratory surgeries, only that it has reduced the need for them.", "'To provide a comprehensive overview of the history and development of various medical imaging technologies' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the history or development of the mentioned techniques, but rather focuses on their importance and potential risks.", "'To compare the effectiveness of different medical imaging techniques in diagnosing specific medical conditions' is incorrect because the passage does not compare the effectiveness of the techniques but highlights their general significance in the field of medicine."], "id": 21021}]
