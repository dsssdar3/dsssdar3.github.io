In 1994, he presented his proof, making headlines around the world. His work not only resolved a centuries-old problem, but also paved the way for advancements in number theory and related fields.", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the claim that Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem had a significant impact on the field of number theory?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Many mathematicians admire Wiles' dedication to solving Fermat's Last Theorem.", "B": "Wiles received numerous awards and honors for his work on Fermat's Last Theorem.", "C": "Wiles' proof was mentioned in several popular science books and documentaries.", "D": "Several groundbreaking research papers in number theory directly cite Wiles' proof as a primary influence."}, "explanation": "D: 'Several groundbreaking research papers in number theory directly cite Wiles' proof as a primary influence.' is the correct answer because it provides direct evidence of the impact of Wiles' work on the field of number theory.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Wiles received numerous awards and honors for his work on Fermat's Last Theorem.' is incorrect because receiving awards doesn't necessarily indicate an impact on the field itself.", "'Wiles' proof was mentioned in several popular science books and documentaries.' is incorrect because this only shows public recognition, not necessarily the impact on the field of number theory.", "'Many mathematicians admire Wiles' dedication to solving Fermat's Last Theorem.' is incorrect because admiration from colleagues isn't a direct indicator of the impact on the field."], "id": 23438}]
