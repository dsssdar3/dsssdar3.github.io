[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Energy storage researchers are focused on developing new technologies, such as solid-state batteries, which have higher energy density and better safety profiles than current lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte, reducing the risk of battery fires and improving overall performance.", "text_2": "Researchers in the energy storage field are also investigating alternative solutions, such as flow batteries. Flow batteries store energy in external liquid electrolyte tanks, providing greater flexibility in scaling energy capacity. Moreover, flow batteries tend to have longer cycle lives compared to lithium-ion batteries."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers in energy storage (Text 2) most likely respond to the development of solid-state batteries discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": " By asserting that solid-state batteries are the only viable solution for future energy storage", "B": " By suggesting that solid-state batteries are a misleading direction for research as they have limited potential", "C": " By dismissing the importance of solid-state batteries and focusing solely on the merits of flow batteries", "D": " By acknowledging the potential benefits of solid-state batteries, but also considering alternative solutions like flow batteries"}, "explanation": "D: 'By acknowledging the potential benefits of solid-state batteries, but also considering alternative solutions like flow batteries' is the correct answer because Text 2 demonstrates that researchers are open to exploring other energy storage solutions, such as flow batteries, while not dismissing the advancements in solid-state batteries discussed in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that solid-state batteries are the only viable solution for future energy storage' is incorrect because Text 2 discusses the potential benefits of flow batteries, indicating that researchers are open to multiple solutions.", "'By suggesting that solid-state batteries are a misleading direction for research as they have limited potential' is incorrect because Text 2 does not criticize solid-state batteries, but rather presents flow batteries as another option.", "'By dismissing the importance of solid-state batteries and focusing solely on the merits of flow batteries' is incorrect because Text 2 does not imply that researchers are ignoring solid-state batteries, but rather that they are considering multiple avenues for energy storage solutions."], "id": 23115}]
