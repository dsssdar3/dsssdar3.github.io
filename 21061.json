[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Economist Jane Smith has argued that a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) should be adjusted to account for the environmental costs of economic growth.

Instead, he proposes the development of a separate index to measure environmental costs, allowing for a clearer distinction between economic growth and environmental impact."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would John Doe (Text 2) most likely respond to the suggestion of adjusting GDP calculations discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": " By acknowledging the importance of considering environmental costs but proposing an alternative solution in the form of a separate index", "B": " By dismissing the idea entirely, arguing that environmental costs have no place in discussions about a country's economy", "C": " By agreeing with Jane Smith's suggestion and emphasizing the importance of accurately representing a nation's economic health", "D": " By suggesting that environmental costs should be included in GDP calculations but only in specific industries or sectors"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the importance of considering environmental costs but proposing an alternative solution in the form of a separate index' is the correct answer because in Text 2, John Doe does not agree with directly including environmental costs in GDP calculations, but rather suggests a separate index for measuring them.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By agreeing with Jane Smith's suggestion and emphasizing the importance of accurately representing a nation's economic health' is incorrect because John Doe proposes an alternative solution in Text 2.", "'By dismissing the idea entirely, arguing that environmental costs have no place in discussions about a country's economy' is incorrect because John Doe acknowledges the importance of considering environmental costs in Text 2.", "'By suggesting that environmental costs should be included in GDP calculations but only in specific industries or sectors' is incorrect because John Doe proposes a separate index for measuring environmental costs in Text 2."], "id": 21061}]
