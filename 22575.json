These early prosthetics were primarily made of wood and metal, and were often heavy and uncomfortable. _______ in recent years, advancements in technology have allowed for the development of lighter, more functional prosthetics made from materials such as carbon fiber and advanced polymers.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Namely", "B": "In addition", "C": "However", "D": "Therefore"}, "explanation": "C: 'However' is the correct answer because it indicates a contrast between the early, less advanced prosthetics and the modern, more advanced ones.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In addition' is incorrect because it would signal that the sentence adds more information about the early prosthetics instead of contrasting them with modern ones.", "'Namely' is incorrect because it would signal that the sentence provides a specific example or detail about the early prosthetics, but the sentence contrasts them with modern ones.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it would signal a consequence or conclusion based on the previous sentence, while the sentence contrasts early prosthetics with modern ones."], "id": 22575}]
