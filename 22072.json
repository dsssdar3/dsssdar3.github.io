[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Squash is a fast-paced racket sport that originated in the 19th century. Played indoors, the sport requires players to hit a small rubber ball against a wall, with the objective of making the ball difficult for their opponent to return. The game is known for its strategic elements and intense physical demands.", "text_2": "While squash is a popular sport worldwide, its inclusion in the Olympic Games has been debated for years. Proponents of the sport's Olympic inclusion argue that the sport's dynamic nature and global appeal make it a perfect fit for the prestigious event. However, others argue that squash's relatively low television viewership and the need to build specialized courts for the competition present significant challenges."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the proponents of Olympic inclusion (Text 2) most likely respond to the strategic elements and physical demands discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "By claiming that these aspects are actually drawbacks, as they create a barrier for potential participants and limit the sport's accessibility.", "B": "By using these aspects as evidence to support their argument that squash's dynamic nature makes it a suitable addition to the Olympic Games.", "C": "By suggesting that these characteristics are irrelevant to the Olympic inclusion debate, and that the focus should be on other factors.", "D": "By proposing that the strategic elements and physical demands be altered in order to make squash more appealing to a wider audience and increase its chances of Olympic inclusion."}, "explanation": "B: 'By using these aspects as evidence to support their argument that squash's dynamic nature makes it a suitable addition to the Olympic Games.' is the correct answer because Text 2 mentions that proponents of squash's Olympic inclusion argue that the sport's dynamic nature and global appeal make it a perfect fit for the event. The strategic elements and physical demands discussed in Text 1 can be considered as part of the sport's dynamic nature.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By claiming that these aspects are actually drawbacks, as they create a barrier for potential participants and limit the sport's accessibility.' is incorrect because the proponents in Text 2 argue in favor of squash's Olympic inclusion and do not mention any drawbacks related to the sport's strategic elements or physical demands.", "'By suggesting that these characteristics are irrelevant to the Olympic inclusion debate, and that the focus should be on other factors.' is incorrect because the proponents in Text 2 would likely use the strategic elements and physical demands as evidence to support their argument, rather than dismissing them as irrelevant.", "'By proposing that the strategic elements and physical demands be altered in order to make squash more appealing to a wider audience and increase its chances of Olympic inclusion.' is incorrect because there is no indication in the texts that the proponents would suggest altering the core aspects of the sport."], "id": 22072}]
