[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "3D printing technology has revolutionized various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. However, one limitation of 3D printing is the available materials, with most printers using only plastic or metal. Researchers are now exploring the possibility of using more sustainable materials, such as plant-based materials, in 3D printing to address this issue and potentially______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "enhance the accuracy of 3D printed objects by improving the resolution of the printing process.", "B": "reduce the environmental impact of 3D printing by decreasing the reliance on nonrenewable resources.", "C": "allow 3D printing technology to replace traditional manufacturing methods entirely in all industries.", "D": "enable the creation of 3D printed objects that are capable of self-replication and autonomous production."}, "explanation": "B: 'reduce the environmental impact of 3D printing by decreasing the reliance on nonrenewable resources.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses the exploration of more sustainable, plant-based materials as a way to address the limitation of available materials in 3D printing.", "distractor_explanation": ["'enhance the accuracy of 3D printed objects by improving the resolution of the printing process.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on addressing the issue of available materials, not the printing resolution.", "'allow 3D printing technology to replace traditional manufacturing methods entirely in all industries.' is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that using sustainable materials will lead to a complete replacement of traditional manufacturing methods.", "'enable the creation of 3D printed objects that are capable of self-replication and autonomous production.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention self-replication or autonomous production as a result of using plant-based materials in 3D printing."], "id": 23533}]
