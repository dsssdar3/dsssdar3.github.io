[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Bionics, the field of combining biological systems with artificial technology, has made remarkable advancements in recent years. Researchers have developed bionic limbs that are capable of mimicking the complex movements of natural limbs. With the incorporation of advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms, these bionic limbs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing users to perform tasks with greater ease and precision. This has significantly improved the quality of life for amputees, and further advancements in bionics hold promise for even more life-changing innovations.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To highlight the advancements in bionics, specifically in the development of bionic limbs, and their impact on the quality of life for amputees", "B": "To discuss the ethical implications of combining biological systems with artificial technology in the field of bionics", "C": "To provide a detailed comparison between traditional prosthetic limbs and the latest bionic limbs available in the market", "D": "To explore the potential for bionic technology in fields other than limb replacement, such as organ transplantation and sensory enhancement"}, "explanation": "A: 'To highlight the advancements in bionics, specifically in the development of bionic limbs, and their impact on the quality of life for amputees' is the correct answer because the passage mainly discusses the progress made in bionic limbs and their positive effects on amputees.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the ethical implications of combining biological systems with artificial technology in the field of bionics' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any ethical concerns related to bionics.", "'To provide a detailed comparison between traditional prosthetic limbs and the latest bionic limbs available in the market' is incorrect because the passage does not specifically compare traditional prosthetics to bionic limbs.", "'To explore the potential for bionic technology in fields other than limb replacement, such as organ transplantation and sensory enhancement' is incorrect because the passage focuses on bionic limbs and does not discuss other applications of bionic technology."], "id": 24022}]
