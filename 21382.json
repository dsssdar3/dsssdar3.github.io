[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Charles Darwin's revolutionary theory of evolution through natural selection was born out of his extensive research on various species. One of his most famous studies was on the Galapagos Islands, where he discovered that the finches had different beak shapes based on their feeding habits. This observation led him to formulate the concept of adaptation, which is a critical component of his evolutionary theory.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The importance of Charles Darwin's research on finches in the Galapagos Islands", "B": "How Darwin's study of finches in the Galapagos contributed to his theory of evolution", "C": "The role of natural selection in the development of species and their traits", "D": "An in-depth analysis of the different beak shapes among the finches on the Galapagos Islands"}, "explanation": "B: 'How Darwin's study of finches in the Galapagos contributed to his theory of evolution' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on how Darwin's observations of finches and their beak shapes led him to the concept of adaptation, which is a significant part of his evolutionary theory.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The importance of Charles Darwin's research on finches in the Galapagos Islands' is incorrect because the passage does not focus solely on the importance of the research, but rather on how it contributed to his theory of evolution.", "'The role of natural selection in the development of species and their traits' is incorrect because the passage does not specifically discuss natural selection, but rather focuses on the concept of adaptation.", "'An in-depth analysis of the different beak shapes among the finches on the Galapagos Islands' is incorrect because the passage does not provide an in-depth analysis of the beak shapes, but instead discusses how the observation of varying beak shapes contributed to Darwin's understanding of adaptation."], "id": 21382}]
