[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Christiaan Huygens, a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist, made groundbreaking discoveries in various fields. He contributed to the development of the pendulum clock, improving timekeeping precision. Huygens' work on the wave theory of light challenged the widely-accepted particle theory, and his studies in probability theory laid the foundation for future mathematicians.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Christiaan Huygens focused primarily on the wave theory of light to disprove particle theory.", "B": "Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock to revolutionize timekeeping.", "C": "Christiaan Huygens' significant contributions spanned multiple scientific disciplines.", "D": "Christiaan Huygens' work in probability theory overshadowed his other achievements."}, "explanation": "C: 'Christiaan Huygens' significant contributions spanned multiple scientific disciplines.' is the correct answer because it captures the overall idea that Huygens made groundbreaking discoveries in various fields, as mentioned in the passage.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock to revolutionize timekeeping.' is incorrect because the passage mentions the pendulum clock as one of Huygens' contributions, not the main focus.", "'Christiaan Huygens focused primarily on the wave theory of light to disprove particle theory.' is incorrect because the passage does not state that it was his primary focus, just one of his significant contributions.", "'Christiaan Huygens' work in probability theory overshadowed his other achievements.' is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that his work in probability theory overshadowed his other contributions."], "id": 24258}]
