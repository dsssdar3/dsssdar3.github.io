[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the American Old West, a group of pioneers known as the Donner Party attempted to reach California by wagon train in 1846. Hindered by harsh weather and poor decision-making, the group became stranded in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Faced with starvation, some members resorted to cannibalism to survive, making their story one of the most infamous in American history. The tragedy led to increased awareness of the dangers of westward travel and prompted efforts to improve the safety of future settlers.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue that the Donner Party's misfortunes were solely due to poor decision-making", "B": "To recount the specific incidents of cannibalism that occurred within the Donner Party", "C": "To provide an overview of the Donner Party's tragic journey and its impact on westward travel", "D": "To emphasize the successful efforts to improve the safety of pioneers in the American Old West"}, "explanation": "C: 'To provide an overview of the Donner Party's tragic journey and its impact on westward travel' is the correct answer because the passage gives a brief account of the Donner Party's experience and mentions the consequences that increased awareness about westward travel.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To recount the specific incidents of cannibalism that occurred within the Donner Party' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions cannibalism and does not focus on specific incidents.", "'To argue that the Donner Party's misfortunes were solely due to poor decision-making' is incorrect because the passage also cites harsh weather as a contributing factor.", "'To emphasize the successful efforts to improve the safety of pioneers in the American Old West' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions these efforts as a consequence of the Donner Party's tragedy."], "id": 21030}]
