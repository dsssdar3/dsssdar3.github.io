In addition to his groundbreaking research in particle physics, Weinberg was also a prolific writer and dedicated educator. _____, he authored several influential textbooks, including the widely used 'Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity'.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "For instance", "B": "In contrast", "C": "However", "D": "Nonetheless"}, "explanation": "A: 'For instance' is the correct answer because it introduces a specific example of Weinberg's writing and educational contributions, which logically follows the previous sentence.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests a contradiction or difference between the two sentences, while the second sentence actually provides an example in support of the first.", "'However' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or exception between the two sentences, which is not the case as the second sentence provides an example of Weinberg's writing and educational contributions.", "'Nonetheless' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or exception to the first sentence, while the second sentence actually provides an example in support of the first."], "id": 24364}]
