[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "While James Joyce's Ulysses is often praised for its stream-of-consciousness style and complexity, his earlier work, Dubliners, offers a more accessible entry point for readers. In this collection of short stories, Joyce _____ his own experiences growing up in Dublin to craft rich, realistic narratives.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "to draw upon", "B": "draws upon", "C": "drawn upon", "D": "drawing upon"}, "explanation": "B: 'draws upon' is the correct answer because it provides the finite present tense verb needed in the main clause to describe Joyce's actions in relation to his experiences.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to draw upon' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive verb does not supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'drawn upon' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle does not supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'drawing upon' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle does not supply the main clause with a finite verb."], "id": 21150}]
