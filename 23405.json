[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, invented the Celsius temperature scale in 1742. He initially proposed a 100-degree scale, with 100 representing the freezing point and 0 representing the boiling point. However, the scale was later reversed, with 0 denoting the freezing point and 100 signifying the boiling point. This change made the Celsius scale more practical and easier to use for scientific purposes.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Anders Celsius's early life and education contributed to his invention of the temperature scale.", "B": "Anders Celsius developed a temperature scale that was later reversed to improve its practicability.", "C": "Anders Celsius faced numerous challenges while creating the Celsius temperature scale.", "D": "The Celsius scale was initially met with skepticism but eventually gained widespread acceptance."}, "explanation": "B: 'Anders Celsius developed a temperature scale that was later reversed to improve its practicability.' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main idea of the passage, detailing the creation of the Celsius scale and its subsequent reversal.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Anders Celsius's early life and education contributed to his invention of the temperature scale.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention his early life or education.", "'Anders Celsius faced numerous challenges while creating the Celsius temperature scale.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss any challenges he faced.", "'The Celsius scale was initially met with skepticism but eventually gained widespread acceptance.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any skepticism or acceptance of the scale."], "id": 23405}]
