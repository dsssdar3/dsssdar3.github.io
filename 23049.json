[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Photovoltaic engineering involves the design, development, and optimization of solar panels. This field of study seeks to improve the efficiency of solar energy conversion and reduce production costs. Researchers in photovoltaic engineering examine materials and manufacturing techniques, such as thin-film technology and multi-junction cells, to enhance the performance of solar panels. By advancing photovoltaic technology, it becomes increasingly feasible for solar energy to become a primary source of power for homes and businesses.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To describe the field of photovoltaic engineering and its focus on improving solar panel efficiency and affordability", "B": "To argue that solar energy should replace all other forms of energy generation in the near future", "C": "To provide a detailed analysis of the manufacturing process of solar panels and their environmental impact", "D": "To discuss the history of photovoltaic engineering and its contributions to the global energy landscape"}, "explanation": "A: 'To describe the field of photovoltaic engineering and its focus on improving solar panel efficiency and affordability' is the correct answer because the text discusses the goals of photovoltaic engineering, such as enhancing solar energy conversion and reducing production costs.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that solar energy should replace all other forms of energy generation in the near future' is incorrect because the text focuses on the objectives of photovoltaic engineering, not on advocating for the complete replacement of other energy sources.", "'To provide a detailed analysis of the manufacturing process of solar panels and their environmental impact' is incorrect because the text briefly mentions manufacturing techniques but does not delve into a detailed analysis or discuss environmental impact.", "'To discuss the history of photovoltaic engineering and its contributions to the global energy landscape' is incorrect because the text focuses on the goals of photovoltaic engineering, not its history or contributions to the global energy landscape."], "id": 23049}]
