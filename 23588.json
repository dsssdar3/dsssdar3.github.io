[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Quantum computing is an emerging technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations much faster than classical computers. These computers leverage the unique properties of qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel computation. _______ the technology is still in its infancy, with many challenges to overcome before it can be widely adopted.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Moreover", "B": "However", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "B: 'However' is the correct answer because it introduces a contrast between the potential promise of quantum computing and the fact that the technology is still in its early stages with many challenges to overcome.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Moreover' is incorrect because it suggests that the following sentence adds to the previous sentence, rather than contrasting with it.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it implies that the following sentence results from the previous sentence, which is not the case.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it indicates a similarity between the two sentences, but the second sentence actually contrasts with the first."], "id": 23588}]
