[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713, ended the War of the Spanish Succession and marked a significant shift in the balance of power in Europe. It resulted in territorial adjustments, including the transfer of Gibraltar and Minorca to Great Britain. The treaty also established new trade agreements that benefited British merchants.", "text_2": "While the Treaty of Utrecht is often viewed as a victory for Great Britain, some historians argue that its long-term consequences were not entirely positive. These critics assert that the treaty laid the groundwork for future conflicts, particularly the Seven Years' War, by creating tensions between European powers."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the historians from Text 2 most likely respond to the 'significant shift in the balance of power' discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that the treaty's benefits for British merchants were more important than the power shift", "B": "By disputing the claim that the treaty resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power", "C": "By acknowledging the shift but emphasizing the negative long-term consequences of the treaty", "D": "By arguing that the treaty's territorial adjustments were not as significant as they are portrayed"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging the shift but emphasizing the negative long-term consequences of the treaty' is the correct answer because it reflects the historians' perspective from Text 2, which acknowledges the Treaty of Utrecht's impact but emphasizes the negative consequences.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By disputing the claim that the treaty resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power' is incorrect because Text 2 does not dispute the power shift but rather focuses on its negative consequences.", "'By suggesting that the treaty's benefits for British merchants were more important than the power shift' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention the benefits for British merchants.", "'By arguing that the treaty's territorial adjustments were not as significant as they are portrayed' is incorrect because Text 2 does not question the significance of the territorial adjustments but focuses on the negative long-term consequences."], "id": 23111}]
