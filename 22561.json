[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian playwright and poet, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986. Soyinka's works often explore themes of political oppression and cultural identity. As an example, his play 'Death and the King's Horseman' is based on a Yoruba ritual and addresses the clash between British colonial powers and Nigerian traditions. _______ his collection of poems, 'A Shuttle in the Crypt', was written during his imprisonment for alleged involvement in Nigeria's civil war.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "In contrast", "B": "Similarly", "C": "On the other hand", "D": "Furthermore"}, "explanation": "D: 'Furthermore' is the correct answer because it indicates that the detail provided in the second sentence adds to the information about Soyinka's works exploring political oppression and cultural identity.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it signals a contrast or difference between the examples, while the passage is providing additional information about Soyinka's works.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it signals that the examples are similar, but the passage is providing an additional instance of Soyinka's work.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it signals a contrast or alternative, which is not the case in the passage as it is providing more information about Soyinka's works."], "id": 22561}]
