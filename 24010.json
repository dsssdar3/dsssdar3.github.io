[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Ergonomics engineering is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing and arranging environments to maximize human efficiency, safety, and comfort. It incorporates knowledge from various disciplines such as biomechanics, psychology, and industrial design to create effective systems that reduce risks associated with repetitive tasks, awkward postures, and excessive force. Ergonomics engineers analyze data from real-life situations to identify potential hazards and develop solutions to mitigate their impact on the human body.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To emphasize the importance of industrial design in the development of ergonomic solutions for reducing risks associated with work-related tasks", "B": "To discuss the psychological aspects of ergonomics engineering and their influence on human behavior in various environments", "C": "To introduce the interdisciplinary field of ergonomics engineering and its goal to improve human efficiency, safety, and comfort", "D": "To provide a detailed explanation of biomechanical principles and their application in the field of ergonomics engineering"}, "explanation": "C: 'To introduce the interdisciplinary field of ergonomics engineering and its goal to improve human efficiency, safety, and comfort' is the correct answer because the passage presents an overview of ergonomics engineering, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature and its objective to maximize efficiency, safety, and comfort in human environments.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the psychological aspects of ergonomics engineering and their influence on human behavior in various environments' is incorrect because the passage mentions psychology as one of the disciplines involved in ergonomics engineering, but it does not focus on psychological aspects.", "'To emphasize the importance of industrial design in the development of ergonomic solutions for reducing risks associated with work-related tasks' is incorrect because, although industrial design is mentioned as a contributing discipline, the passage does not specifically emphasize its importance.", "'To provide a detailed explanation of biomechanical principles and their application in the field of ergonomics engineering' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions biomechanics as a contributing discipline but does not provide a detailed explanation of its principles or applications."], "id": 24010}]
