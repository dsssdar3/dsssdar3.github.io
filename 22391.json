[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Hydrogen fuel cell technology has become a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its eco-friendly nature. These fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water as a byproduct. As a result, hydrogen fuel cells have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a cleaner environment. However, challenges remain in terms of storage, transportation, and cost, which must be addressed for widespread adoption.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The passage highlights the negative environmental impacts of hydrogen fuel cell technology.", "B": "The passage emphasizes the eco-friendly potential of hydrogen fuel cells while acknowledging existing challenges.", "C": "The passage discusses the various applications of hydrogen fuel cells in different industries.", "D": "The passage focuses on the cost and financial aspects of implementing hydrogen fuel cell technology."}, "explanation": "B: 'The passage emphasizes the eco-friendly potential of hydrogen fuel cells while acknowledging existing challenges.' is the correct answer because it captures the main idea of the text, which discusses the environmental benefits of hydrogen fuel cells and the remaining challenges for widespread adoption.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The passage highlights the negative environmental impacts of hydrogen fuel cell technology.' is incorrect because the text focuses on the positive environmental aspects of the technology and the challenges in its implementation.", "'The passage discusses the various applications of hydrogen fuel cells in different industries.' is incorrect because the text does not delve into specific industries or applications.", "'The passage focuses on the cost and financial aspects of implementing hydrogen fuel cell technology.' is incorrect because while the passage does mention cost as a challenge, it also discusses storage and transportation, and emphasizes the eco-friendly potential of the technology."], "id": 22391}]
