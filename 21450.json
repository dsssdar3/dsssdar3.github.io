[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Command of Evidence", "passage": "John Dalton, an English chemist, developed the first widely accepted atomic theory in the 1800s. His theory proposed that all matter is made up of small, indivisible particles called atoms. Dalton also suggested that each element has its own unique type of atom, with distinct properties including atomic weight.", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly challenge Dalton's atomic theory?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Some elements are observed to have atoms with nearly identical atomic weights.", "B": "A newly discovered element is found to have atoms that can be broken down into smaller particles.", "C": "Further research reveals a previously unknown element with unique atomic properties.", "D": "A specific element's atoms are found to have slightly varying atomic weights."}, "explanation": "B: 'A newly discovered element is found to have atoms that can be broken down into smaller particles.' is the correct answer because it directly contradicts Dalton's assertion that atoms are indivisible and would challenge the fundamental basis of his atomic theory.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Some elements are observed to have atoms with nearly identical atomic weights.' is incorrect because it doesn't directly challenge the indivisibility of atoms or their unique properties, which are central to Dalton's theory.", "'Further research reveals a previously unknown element with unique atomic properties.' is incorrect because the discovery of a new element with unique properties would actually support Dalton's theory that each element has its own unique type of atom.", "'A specific element's atoms are found to have slightly varying atomic weights.' is incorrect because it doesn't challenge the idea that atoms are indivisible, which is a key aspect of Dalton's atomic theory."], "id": 21450}]
