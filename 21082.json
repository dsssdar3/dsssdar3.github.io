[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones across a sheet of ice towards a target area. Teams take turns sliding the stones, attempting to get them as close to the center of the target as possible. A key component of the game is the use of sweeping to control the stone's trajectory and speed.", "text_2": "A study conducted by sports scientist Dr. Emily Johnson and colleagues suggested that the sweeping technique employed by curling players has a significant impact on the stone's movement. The study found that when players swept the ice in front of the stone, it created a thin film of water, reducing friction between the ice and the stone, allowing it to travel further and more accurately."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Emily Johnson and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the importance of sweeping in curling discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that sweeping techniques should be replaced with advanced technology to improve stone control.", "B": "By arguing that sweeping is overrated and has a negligible effect on the stone's movement across the ice.", "C": "By providing empirical evidence that supports the significance of sweeping in controlling the stone's trajectory and speed.", "D": "By questioning the ethics of sweeping as an element of gameplay and calling for its removal from the sport."}, "explanation": "C: 'By providing empirical evidence that supports the significance of sweeping in controlling the stone's trajectory and speed.' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses a study that demonstrates the impact of sweeping on the stone's movement, aligning with the importance of sweeping mentioned in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that sweeping is overrated and has a negligible effect on the stone's movement across the ice.' is incorrect because Text 2 actually supports the significance of sweeping.", "'By suggesting that sweeping techniques should be replaced with advanced technology to improve stone control.' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention any technological alternatives to sweeping.", "'By questioning the ethics of sweeping as an element of gameplay and calling for its removal from the sport.' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the scientific impact of sweeping, not its ethical implications."], "id": 21082}]
