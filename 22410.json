[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In mining engineering, spatial analysis plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of mineral deposits. By utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology, mining engineers can identify potential mining sites and evaluate their economic viability. This approach not only streamlines the exploration process but also helps in minimizing potential environmental impacts and ensuring sustainable mining practices.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "The role of mining engineers in minimizing environmental impacts and ensuring that mining practices remain sustainable", "B": "The use of GIS and remote sensing to identify mineral deposits and eliminate the need for traditional exploration methods", "C": "The importance of spatial analysis in mining engineering for identifying potential mining sites and promoting sustainability", "D": "The application of spatial analysis in mining engineering to improve the economic viability of mining projects"}, "explanation": "C: 'The importance of spatial analysis in mining engineering for identifying potential mining sites and promoting sustainability' is the correct answer because it captures the main idea of the text by highlighting the role of spatial analysis in the mining engineering field.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The use of GIS and remote sensing to identify mineral deposits and eliminate the need for traditional exploration methods' is incorrect because it only focuses on the technology used, not the overall purpose of spatial analysis.", "'The role of mining engineers in minimizing environmental impacts and ensuring that mining practices remain sustainable' is incorrect because it emphasizes the role of the engineers rather than the importance of spatial analysis.", "'The application of spatial analysis in mining engineering to improve the economic viability of mining projects' is incorrect because it only highlights one aspect of spatial analysis rather than the broader purpose discussed in the passage."], "id": 22410}]
