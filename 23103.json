[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer, played a vital role in the development of extragalactic astronomy. His observations of galaxies beyond the Milky Way led to the conclusion that the universe is expanding, a concept that forms the basis of modern cosmology. Hubble's law states that the speed at which a galaxy recedes is proportional to its distance from the observer. This discovery has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe.", "text_2": "In recent years, some scientists have questioned the accuracy of Hubble's law, pointing to discrepancies between the law's predictions and actual observations. These researchers argue that factors such as dark energy and the distribution of matter in the universe could affect the rate of expansion, leading to deviations from Hubble's law. They suggest that a more complex model of the universe's expansion might be needed to fully explain these discrepancies."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers from Text 2 most likely respond to the concept of Hubble's law discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": " By asserting that Hubble's law is the definitive explanation for the universe's expansion and requires no further investigation", "B": " By praising Hubble's discovery but suggesting that it only applies to galaxies within the Milky Way", "C": " By acknowledging the significance of Hubble's law, but arguing that it may not fully account for the complexities of the universe's expansion", "D": " By completely dismissing Hubble's law as a flawed theory with no basis in reality"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging the significance of Hubble's law, but arguing that it may not fully account for the complexities of the universe's expansion' is the correct answer because Text 2 describes researchers who point to discrepancies between Hubble's law's predictions and actual observations, and suggest that a more complex model might be needed.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that Hubble's law is the definitive explanation for the universe's expansion and requires no further investigation' is incorrect because Text 2 discusses researchers who question the accuracy of Hubble's law.", "'By praising Hubble's discovery but suggesting that it only applies to galaxies within the Milky Way' is incorrect because Text 2 specifically mentions discrepancies in observations of galaxies beyond the Milky Way.", "'By completely dismissing Hubble's law as a flawed theory with no basis in reality' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest that the researchers completely disregard Hubble's law, but rather that it may not fully account for the complexities of the universe's expansion."], "id": 23103}]
