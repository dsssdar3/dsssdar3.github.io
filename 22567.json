[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Kip Thorne, a renowned theoretical physicist, has made significant contributions to the understanding of gravitational waves and black holes. In 1994, along with his colleagues, he co-founded the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, which aimed to detect gravitational waves. _______ in 2016, LIGO made history by detecting the first gravitational waves, validating Einstein's theory of general relativity.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "In contrast", "B": "Alternatively", "C": "Subsequently", "D": "Nonetheless"}, "explanation": "C: 'Subsequently' is the correct answer because it logically shows that the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO followed the establishment of the project.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests that the detection of gravitational waves was an alternative to the establishment of LIGO, rather than a result of it.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between the establishment of LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves, which is not the case.", "'Nonetheless' is incorrect because it suggests that the detection of gravitational waves happened despite the establishment of LIGO, rather than as a result of it."], "id": 22567}]
