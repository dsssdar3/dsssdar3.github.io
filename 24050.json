[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "During the Progressive Era, labor unions became increasingly influential in American politics and society. They fought for better working conditions, higher wages, and shorter hours for workers. While successful in achieving some of their goals, they faced significant opposition from businesses that sought to maintain control over their workforce.", "text_2": "In the Progressive Era, muckraking journalists played a crucial role in exposing the harsh working conditions and unfair labor practices that were rampant in many industries. Their investigative reporting informed the public and put pressure on politicians to enact reforms to improve workers' lives. The impact of these journalists was pivotal in achieving some of the changes that labor unions also sought."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the muckraking journalists (Text 2) most likely respond to the labor unions' efforts discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By opposing the labor unions' goals, arguing that their demands for better working conditions would ultimately harm the economy", "B": "By criticizing the labor unions for not doing enough to promote change, arguing that journalism was a more effective tool", "C": "By remaining neutral and focusing solely on their journalistic work, without engaging in the political struggle between labor unions and businesses", "D": "By supporting and amplifying the labor unions' cause, as both groups sought to improve workers' conditions and rights"}, "explanation": "D: 'By supporting and amplifying the labor unions' cause, as both groups sought to improve workers' conditions and rights' is the correct answer because both texts describe the efforts of labor unions and muckraking journalists as focused on improving working conditions and reforming unfair labor practices.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By criticizing the labor unions for not doing enough to promote change, arguing that journalism was a more effective tool' is incorrect because neither text suggests that muckraking journalists saw themselves as superior to labor unions.", "'By remaining neutral and focusing solely on their journalistic work, without engaging in the political struggle between labor unions and businesses' is incorrect because Text 2 implies that muckraking journalists actively sought to expose and reform the issues that labor unions were fighting against.", "'By opposing the labor unions' goals, arguing that their demands for better working conditions would ultimately harm the economy' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention any opposition to labor unions' goals from muckraking journalists, and both groups aimed to improve workers' lives."], "id": 24050}]
