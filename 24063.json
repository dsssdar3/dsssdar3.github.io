[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Virginia Woolf is well-known for her use of stream of consciousness, a literary technique that presents a character's thoughts and feelings as they occur in real time. This technique is prevalent in Woolf's novels, such as 'Mrs. Dalloway' and 'To the Lighthouse.'", "text_2": "Some critics argue that Woolf's stream of consciousness technique detracts from the narrative structure of her works, making them difficult to follow for some readers.
