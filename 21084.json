[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Labor unions have long advocated for collective bargaining, a process in which union representatives negotiate with employers on behalf of union members for improved wages, benefits, and working conditions. Proponents argue that collective bargaining levels the playing field between workers and employers, resulting in fairer labor practices.", "text_2": "Economist Dr. Emily Johnson and her team argue that the traditional view of collective bargaining as a means to achieve fair labor practices may be oversimplified. They assert that while it can lead to better working conditions, it may also contribute to unemployment in certain industries due to increased labor costs."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Emily Johnson and her team (Text 2) most likely respond to the advocacy of collective bargaining discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging its potential benefits but cautioning about its possible negative effects on unemployment", "B": "By suggesting that collective bargaining is an outdated practice that should be replaced", "C": "By stating that collective bargaining is universally beneficial for all industries and workers", "D": "By rejecting the idea of collective bargaining, arguing that it is entirely detrimental to the economy"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging its potential benefits but cautioning about its possible negative effects on unemployment' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses Dr. Emily Johnson and her team's view that the traditional view of collective bargaining may be oversimplified, and that while it can lead to better working conditions, it may also contribute to unemployment in certain industries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By stating that collective bargaining is universally beneficial for all industries and workers' is incorrect because, according to Text 2, Dr. Emily Johnson and her team acknowledge the potential negative effects of collective bargaining.", "'By suggesting that collective bargaining is an outdated practice that should be replaced' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention Dr. Emily Johnson and her team proposing any alternatives or considering it outdated.", "'By rejecting the idea of collective bargaining, arguing that it is entirely detrimental to the economy' is incorrect because Text 2 states that Dr. Emily Johnson and her team acknowledge the potential benefits of collective bargaining, despite also discussing its potential negative effects."], "id": 21084}]
