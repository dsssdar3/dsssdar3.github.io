[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Boundaries", "passage": "Zora Neale Hurston was an influential African-American writer, anthropologist, and filmmaker who contributed greatly to the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston's extensive body of work includes novels, essays, and plays that often explore themes of racial identity and the African-American experience. One of her most notable works, Their Eyes Were Watching God, was published in 1937, and it still ______ in classrooms and literary circles today.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "resonates deeply,", "B": "resonates, deeply", "C": "resonates deeply", "D": "resonates, deeply,"}, "explanation": "A: 'resonates deeply,' is the correct answer because it properly uses an adverb to modify the verb 'resonates' without requiring any additional punctuation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'resonates deeply' is incorrect because it lacks the necessary comma after 'deeply' to separate it from the following clause.", "'resonates, deeply' is incorrect because it separates the adverb 'deeply' from the verb 'resonates' with a comma, which is unnecessary.", "'resonates, deeply,' is incorrect because it combines the errors from both choices B and C by separating 'deeply' from 'resonates' and lacking a comma after 'deeply'."], "id": 23263}]
