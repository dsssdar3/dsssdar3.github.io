[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, is best known for his work on the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. His discoveries led to the formulation of Ohm's Law, which states that the current flowing through a conductor is _______ to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to its resistance.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "proportional", "B": "independent", "C": "unrelated", "D": "negligible"}, "explanation": "A: 'proportional' is the correct answer because it accurately describes the relationship between current and voltage in Ohm's Law.", "distractor_explanation": ["'independent' is incorrect because the relationship between current and voltage is not independent in Ohm's Law.", "'unrelated' is incorrect because Ohm's Law specifically describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance.", "'negligible' is incorrect because the relationship is not insignificant, but rather clearly defined in Ohm's Law."], "id": 24232}]
