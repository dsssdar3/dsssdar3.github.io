Among his most notable achievements was the discovery of the nature of chemical bonds, which led to the development of the field of molecular biology. Pauling's work in this area earned him a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. Later, he became an advocate for the health benefits of vitamin C, despite facing criticism from some members of the scientific community.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To discuss in detail the nature of chemical bonds and the development of molecular biology as a field", "B": "To praise Linus Pauling for his groundbreaking research in molecular biology, while also criticizing his work on vitamin C", "C": "To provide an overview of Linus Pauling's scientific accomplishments and his advocacy for vitamin C", "D": "To provide a comprehensive biography of Linus Pauling, focusing on his personal and professional life"}, "explanation": "C: 'To provide an overview of Linus Pauling's scientific accomplishments and his advocacy for vitamin C' is the correct answer because the passage briefly discusses Pauling's achievements in chemistry and molecular biology, as well as his work on vitamin C.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To praise Linus Pauling for his groundbreaking research in molecular biology, while also criticizing his work on vitamin C' is incorrect because the passage does not criticize Pauling's work on vitamin C, but merely mentions the criticism he faced.", "'To discuss in detail the nature of chemical bonds and the development of molecular biology as a field' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions these topics in relation to Pauling's work.", "'To provide a comprehensive biography of Linus Pauling, focusing on his personal and professional life' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Pauling's scientific contributions, not his personal life or a comprehensive biography."], "id": 22024}]
