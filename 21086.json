[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Autonomous robots have been studied for their potential to work in hazardous environments, such as nuclear disaster sites, where human presence is dangerous. Researchers have developed robots with advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze their surroundings and make decisions independently. These robots are expected to improve safety and efficiency in such situations.", "text_2": "Another group of researchers argues that the current technology of autonomous robots is not yet mature enough to guarantee reliable operation in hazardous environments. They suggest that a combination of human-robot collaboration, where robots are remotely controlled to perform tasks while humans oversee their actions, may be more appropriate for these situations until the technology advances further."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the potential of autonomous robots in hazardous environments discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": " By supporting the idea of fully autonomous robots for hazardous environments without any human intervention", "B": " By questioning the need for autonomous robots in hazardous environments, as other technologies may be more suitable", "C": " By dismissing the entire concept of using robots in hazardous environments and advocating for traditional human-led methods", "D": " By expressing concerns about the maturity of autonomous robot technology and suggesting human-robot collaboration as an alternative"}, "explanation": "D: 'By expressing concerns about the maturity of autonomous robot technology and suggesting human-robot collaboration as an alternative' is the correct answer because Text 2 indicates that the researchers believe the technology is not yet mature enough and propose a combination of human-robot collaboration as a more suitable solution for now.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By supporting the idea of fully autonomous robots for hazardous environments without any human intervention' is incorrect because Text 2 suggests a more cautious approach with human-robot collaboration.", "'By questioning the need for autonomous robots in hazardous environments, as other technologies may be more suitable' is incorrect because Text 2 does not question the need for robots, but rather their level of autonomy.", "'By dismissing the entire concept of using robots in hazardous environments and advocating for traditional human-led methods' is incorrect because Text 2 does not reject using robots, but instead proposes a different approach involving human oversight."], "id": 21086}]
