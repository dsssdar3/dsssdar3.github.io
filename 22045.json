[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the 18th century, William Herschel, an astronomer known for his discoveries in deep space, was also a gifted musician. He devoted much of his early life to composing and teaching music before focusing on astronomy. Herschel's musical background aided him in his astronomical research, as he applied mathematical principles from music theory to develop new methods for investigating the cosmos. This interdisciplinary approach allowed him to make groundbreaking discoveries, such as the identification of Uranus, the first planet discovered since antiquity.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To describe the teaching methods William Herschel employed during his early career as a music instructor", "B": "To examine the impact of William Herschel's musical compositions on the development of classical music in the 18th century", "C": "To explain how William Herschel's background in music contributed to his innovative methods and astronomical discoveries", "D": "To analyze the relationship between mathematical principles found in music theory and the field of astronomy"}, "explanation": "C: 'To explain how William Herschel's background in music contributed to his innovative methods and astronomical discoveries' is the correct answer because the passage discusses how Herschel's musical background and knowledge of mathematical principles from music theory helped him develop new methods for investigating the cosmos, leading to groundbreaking discoveries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To examine the impact of William Herschel's musical compositions on the development of classical music in the 18th century' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the impact of Herschel's compositions on classical music.", "'To describe the teaching methods William Herschel employed during his early career as a music instructor' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Herschel's teaching methods.", "'To analyze the relationship between mathematical principles found in music theory and the field of astronomy' is incorrect because, although the passage touches on the connection between music theory and astronomy, it primarily focuses on how Herschel's musical background contributed to his astronomical research and discoveries."], "id": 22045}]
