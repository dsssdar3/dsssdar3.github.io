[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Artificial photosynthesis aims to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis to produce clean energy from sunlight and water. Researchers have been attempting to develop systems that use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and energy-rich fuels. Although there have been significant advancements in this field, scientists still face challenges in creating efficient, scalable, and sustainable artificial photosynthesis systems.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Artificial photosynthesis researchers have fully replicated natural photosynthesis.", "B": "The production of oxygen is the primary goal of artificial photosynthesis.", "C": "Artificial photosynthesis aims to produce clean energy by imitating natural processes.", "D": "Solar energy is an inefficient source for artificial photosynthesis systems."}, "explanation": "C: 'Artificial photosynthesis aims to produce clean energy by imitating natural processes.' is the correct answer because the passage describes the goal of artificial photosynthesis as creating clean energy by mimicking the natural process of photosynthesis.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Artificial photosynthesis researchers have fully replicated natural photosynthesis.' is incorrect because the passage mentions ongoing challenges in developing efficient systems.", "'The production of oxygen is the primary goal of artificial photosynthesis.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the production of clean energy, with oxygen as a byproduct.", "'Solar energy is an inefficient source for artificial photosynthesis systems.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the efficiency of solar energy in artificial photosynthesis systems."], "id": 24260}]
