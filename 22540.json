[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Hydroponics, a modern method of cultivating plants, allows plants to grow without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. In traditional agriculture, plants draw nutrients from the soil, while hydroponics provides them directly to the roots. _______ the method eliminates the need for large areas of arable land, making it suitable for urban environments.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Similarly,", "B": "On the other hand,", "C": "Alternatively,", "D": "As a result,"}, "explanation": "D: 'As a result' is the correct answer because it logically shows the consequence of providing nutrients directly to the roots in hydroponics, which is the elimination of the need for large areas of arable land.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it suggests that the sentence adds a similar point to the previous one, whereas it actually presents a consequence.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or alternative, but the sentence is presenting a consequence of the previous information.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative option or possibility, but the sentence is showing the result of using hydroponics."], "id": 22540}]
