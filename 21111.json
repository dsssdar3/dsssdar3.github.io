[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Robert Hooke, a 17th-century English scientist, is known for his work in various scientific fields, such as physics, biology, and geology. Among his most famous contributions is the coining of the term 'cell' when observing cork under a microscope, which led to the foundation of cell biology.", "text_2": "Hooke's Law, another significant contribution by Robert Hooke, is a principle in physics that states the force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance is proportional to that distance. This law has been applied in numerous fields, including engineering and materials science."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the description of Hooke's Law (Text 2) most likely respond to the 'cell' concept discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By emphasizing the importance of Hooke's Law in the development of cell biology and the understanding of microscopic structures", "B": "By arguing that Hooke's Law provides a more accurate and comprehensive framework for studying various scientific fields, including cell biology", "C": "By acknowledging that both the 'cell' concept and Hooke's Law demonstrate the versatility and wide-ranging impact of Robert Hooke's contributions to science", "D": "By implying that the discovery of the 'cell' concept was overshadowed by the development of Hooke's Law, as it had broader applications across disciplines"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging that both the 'cell' concept and Hooke's Law demonstrate the versatility and wide-ranging impact of Robert Hooke's contributions to science' is the correct answer because both texts focus on different aspects of Hooke's work, highlighting his diverse contributions to various scientific fields.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing the importance of Hooke's Law in the development of cell biology and the understanding of microscopic structures' is incorrect because Text 2 does not discuss Hooke's Law's relevance to cell biology.", "'By arguing that Hooke's Law provides a more accurate and comprehensive framework for studying various scientific fields, including cell biology' is incorrect because Text 2 does not compare the significance of Hooke's Law to the 'cell' concept.", "'By implying that the discovery of the 'cell' concept was overshadowed by the development of Hooke's Law, as it had broader applications across disciplines' is incorrect because neither text suggests that one contribution was more important or overshadowed the other."], "id": 21111}]
