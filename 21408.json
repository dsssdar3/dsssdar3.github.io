His work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the groundwork for classical mechanics, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. Newton's innovative approach to problem-solving, combined with his insatiable curiosity, enabled him to develop groundbreaking theories that continue to influence modern science.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Isaac Newton's work on universal gravitation was his most important contribution to the field of science.", "B": "Isaac Newton's contributions to science and mathematics have had a lasting impact on our understanding of the universe.", "C": "Isaac Newton was a curious individual, which made him successful in his scientific endeavors.", "D": "Isaac Newton's theories were a result of his ability to approach problems from a unique perspective."}, "explanation": "B: 'Isaac Newton's contributions to science and mathematics have had a lasting impact on our understanding of the universe.' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main idea of the text, which highlights Newton's significant contributions and their enduring influence on science.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Isaac Newton's work on universal gravitation was his most important contribution to the field of science.' is incorrect because the text emphasizes multiple contributions, not just universal gravitation.", "'Isaac Newton was a curious individual, which made him successful in his scientific endeavors.' is incorrect because the text focuses on Newton's contributions and their impact, not solely on his curiosity.", "'Isaac Newton's theories were a result of his ability to approach problems from a unique perspective.' is incorrect because the main idea of the text is the lasting impact of Newton's contributions, not the process by which he arrived at his theories."], "id": 21408}]
