[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "During the Cold War, the policy of mutually assured destruction (MAD) emerged as a deterrent against nuclear war. This concept asserted that if one superpower launched a nuclear attack, the other would retaliate with equal or greater force, resulting in the annihilation of both nations. The doctrine of MAD relied on the notion that neither side would risk initiating a nuclear conflict, knowing that it would lead to their own destruction.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that the policy of mutually assured destruction was an effective solution for preventing nuclear war", "B": "To explain the concept of mutually assured destruction and its role as a deterrent during the Cold War", "C": "To describe the development of nuclear weapons technology and the implications for international relations", "D": "To analyze the reasons for the eventual end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the policy of mutually assured destruction"}, "explanation": "B: 'To explain the concept of mutually assured destruction and its role as a deterrent during the Cold War' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main purpose of the text, which is to introduce the concept of MAD and explain its function as a deterrent against nuclear war.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that the policy of mutually assured destruction was an effective solution for preventing nuclear war' is incorrect because the text does not make a specific argument about the effectiveness of MAD in preventing nuclear war, but rather explains its role as a deterrent.", "'To describe the development of nuclear weapons technology and the implications for international relations' is incorrect because the text does not discuss the development of nuclear weapons technology, but rather focuses on the concept of MAD.", "'To analyze the reasons for the eventual end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the policy of mutually assured destruction' is incorrect because the text does not address the end of the Cold War or the dissolution of MAD."], "id": 23022}]
