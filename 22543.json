[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is widely recognized as the world's first computer programmer. Born in 1815, she was the only legitimate daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. Lovelace's mother, fearing that her daughter might inherit Byron's romantic and unpredictable temperament, encouraged her to study mathematics and logic. _______ in 1833, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, who was working on his Analytical Engine, a machine designed to perform complex calculations. This encounter would change the course of her life and lead to significant contributions in the field of computing.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "On the other hand", "C": "Consequently", "D": "In contrast"}, "explanation": "C: 'Consequently' is the correct answer because it logically signals the result of Lovelace's mother encouraging her to study mathematics and logic, which led to her meeting Babbage and making significant contributions in the field of computing.", "distractor_explanation": ["'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or alternative to the previous statement, rather than a logical consequence of Lovelace's mother encouraging her to study.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it suggests a similarity between two statements, whereas the blank space requires a transition that shows a consequence or result.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or opposition to the previous statement, rather than a logical consequence of Lovelace's mother encouraging her to study."], "id": 22543}]
