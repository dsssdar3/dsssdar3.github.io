[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Free trade has long been a controversial issue in economic policy. Critics argue that free trade can lead to job losses and lower wages, while proponents claim it promotes economic efficiency and growth. However, the benefits and disadvantages of free trade are not equally distributed among nations, with developed countries often gaining more advantages due to their advanced technologies and resources. This has led to calls for a more balanced approach to international trade agreements to ensure that all countries can benefit from the global market.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To present an overview of the debate surrounding free trade and its uneven distribution of benefits", "B": "To argue that free trade is a universally beneficial policy that should be widely adopted by all countries", "C": "To criticize developed countries for taking advantage of free trade agreements to exploit less developed nations", "D": "To suggest that job losses and lower wages are the only negative consequences of free trade policies"}, "explanation": "A: 'To present an overview of the debate surrounding free trade and its uneven distribution of benefits' is the correct answer because the passage discusses both the advantages and disadvantages of free trade, as well as the unequal distribution of benefits among nations.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that free trade is a universally beneficial policy that should be widely adopted by all countries' is incorrect because the passage acknowledges the disadvantages and uneven distribution of benefits, rather than solely promoting free trade.", "'To criticize developed countries for taking advantage of free trade agreements to exploit less developed nations' is incorrect because the passage does not specifically accuse developed countries of exploitation, but rather calls for a more balanced approach in international trade agreements.", "'To suggest that job losses and lower wages are the only negative consequences of free trade policies' is incorrect because the passage also discusses the unequal distribution of benefits among nations and calls for a more balanced approach to trade agreements."], "id": 23059}]
