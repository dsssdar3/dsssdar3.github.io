He is best known for his invention of the pendulum clock, a device that improved timekeeping accuracy by orders of magnitude. Huygens also formulated the wave theory of light, which describes light as a series of ______ propagating through a medium.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "wave\u2019s", "B": "waves\u2019", "C": "waves", "D": "wave"}, "explanation": "C: 'waves' is the correct answer because it is the plural form of 'wave,' correctly referring to multiple instances of light waves propagating.", "distractor_explanation": ["'wave\u2019s' is incorrect because it is a singular possessive form, which does not fit the context of the sentence.", "'waves\u2019' is incorrect because it is a plural possessive form, which does not fit the context of the sentence.", "'wave' is incorrect because it is a singular form, which does not fit the context of the sentence, which describes multiple instances of light waves propagating."], "id": 21289}]
