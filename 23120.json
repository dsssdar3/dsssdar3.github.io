He is best known for his work in heat transfer and vibrations, which led to the development of the Fourier series. His groundbreaking research ______ the foundation for the field of modern signal processing.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "laid", "B": "laying", "C": "to lay", "D": "will lay"}, "explanation": "A: 'laid' is the correct answer because it provides the main clause with a finite past tense verb, indicating that Fourier's research established the foundation for the field of modern signal processing in the past.", "distractor_explanation": ["'laying' is incorrect because it is a nonfinite present participle and does not provide the main clause with a finite verb.", "'to lay' is incorrect because it is a nonfinite to-infinitive verb and does not provide the main clause with a finite verb.", "'will lay' is incorrect because it is a future tense verb, suggesting that Fourier's research will establish the foundation for the field in the future, which is not accurate."], "id": 23120}]
