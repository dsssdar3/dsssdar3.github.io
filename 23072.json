[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Sylvia Plath, a renowned American poet, is perhaps best known for her confessional poetry, which often explores themes of depression, anxiety, and the inner workings of her mind. Plath's unique style combines vivid imagery and raw emotion, creating a deeply personal connection with her readers.", "text_2": "Some literary critics argue that Plath's poetry, while emotionally powerful, is limited by its focus on her own experiences and emotions.
