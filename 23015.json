[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Chemical engineering has evolved significantly over the past century. Initially, the field was primarily concerned with the large-scale production of chemicals and the design of equipment for industrial processes. However, modern chemical engineers focus on a wide array of applications, including renewable energy, advanced materials, and even biomedical engineering. As a result, chemical engineers now have a more diverse set of skills that allow them to contribute to various industries.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the specific skills required for chemical engineers to be successful in the field of renewable energy", "B": "To argue that chemical engineers should return to their roots by focusing on large-scale chemical production and equipment design", "C": "To highlight the evolution of chemical engineering from its early focus on industrial processes to its modern diverse applications", "D": "To suggest that the field of chemical engineering may soon become obsolete due to advancements in other areas of technology"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the evolution of chemical engineering from its early focus on industrial processes to its modern diverse applications' is the correct answer because the passage describes the changes in the field of chemical engineering, from its original focus on producing chemicals and designing equipment to its current applications in various industries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that chemical engineers should return to their roots by focusing on large-scale chemical production and equipment design' is incorrect because the passage does not advocate for a return to the original focus of chemical engineering, but rather highlights its evolution and diverse applications.", "'To discuss the specific skills required for chemical engineers to be successful in the field of renewable energy' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions renewable energy as an application, but does not discuss specific skills or focus on this aspect.", "'To suggest that the field of chemical engineering may soon become obsolete due to advancements in other areas of technology' is incorrect because the passage does not imply that chemical engineering is becoming obsolete, but rather emphasizes the expansion of its applications."], "id": 23015}]
