[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Charlotte Bronte, a 19th-century English novelist, is best known for her novel Jane Eyre, which challenged social norms by featuring a strong, independent female protagonist. Critics at the time of its publication were divided, with some praising its originality and others condemning it for its moral transgression.", "text_2": "Biographer Juliet Barker, in her book 'The Brontes,' argues that Charlotte Bronte's groundbreaking portrayal of women in her novels is a reflection of her own experiences and struggles with societal expectations. Barker suggests that Bronte's female characters embody her desire for independence and equality."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Juliet Barker (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201ccritics\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By emphasizing that Charlotte Bronte's novel was a product of its time, and the critics were not able to fully understand its significance", "B": "By asserting that the critics were correct in their condemnation of the novel, as it was indeed morally transgressive", "C": "By recommending that critics should focus more on the literary merits of the novel rather than the societal norms it challenges", "D": "By suggesting that the critics' negative reactions to the novel were due to a misunderstanding of Bronte's personal experiences and intentions"}, "explanation": "D: 'By suggesting that the critics' negative reactions to the novel were due to a misunderstanding of Bronte's personal experiences and intentions' is the correct answer because Text 2 explains that Juliet Barker believes Charlotte Bronte's portrayal of women in her novels is a reflection of her own experiences and struggles with societal expectations.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing that Charlotte Bronte's novel was a product of its time, and the critics were not able to fully understand its significance' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention the context of the novel's publication as a factor in the critics' reactions.", "'By asserting that the critics were correct in their condemnation of the novel, as it was indeed morally transgressive' is incorrect because Text 2 supports Bronte's portrayal of women and does not agree with the critics' condemnation.", "'By recommending that critics should focus more on the literary merits of the novel rather than the societal norms it challenges' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the relationship between Bronte's personal experiences and her portrayal of women, not on the literary merits of the novel."], "id": 24072}]
