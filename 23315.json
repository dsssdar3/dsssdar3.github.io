[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "In materials science, the process of precipitation hardening, also known as age hardening, is used to improve the strength and hardness of certain alloys. This is achieved by creating a uniform distribution of fine particles within the alloy, which ______ the movement of dislocations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "hinders", "B": "simplifies", "C": "ignores", "D": "accelerates"}, "explanation": "A: 'hinders' is the correct answer because precipitation hardening aims to improve the strength and hardness of alloys by preventing the movement of dislocations within the material.", "distractor_explanation": ["'simplifies' is incorrect because precipitation hardening does not aim to simplify the movement of dislocations, but rather to restrict it.", "'ignores' is incorrect because the process specifically targets the movement of dislocations to improve the alloy's properties.", "'accelerates' is incorrect because the goal of precipitation hardening is to restrict the movement of dislocations, not speed it up."], "id": 23315}]
