[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in 1886 and symbolizes freedom and democracy. It was originally intended to celebrate the centennial of the United States and to showcase France's commitment to Enlightenment ideals. The statue's design, created by sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, features a crown with seven rays representing the seven continents and the concept of liberty shining across the world.", "text_2": "The Statue of Liberty's iconic green color is a result of the natural weathering of the copper that makes up its exterior. The patina, which formed over several decades, protects the metal beneath it from further corrosion. Some have argued that the green patina adds an additional layer of symbolism to the monument, representing the resilience and adaptability of the American spirit."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the original purpose of the Statue of Liberty as discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging the original purpose while also suggesting that the patina adds another layer of meaning related to the American spirit", "B": "By arguing that the original purpose has been replaced by the statue's representation of resilience and adaptability due to its patina", "C": "By emphasizing the importance of the statue's design features, such as the crown and torch, in conveying its intended message", "D": "By questioning whether the statue's original purpose is still relevant today, given the changes in political and social contexts"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the original purpose while also suggesting that the patina adds another layer of meaning related to the American spirit' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses the green patina as possibly adding a layer of symbolism related to resilience and adaptability, without dismissing the original purpose of the statue.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing the importance of the statue's design features, such as the crown and torch, in conveying its intended message' is incorrect because Text 2 does not discuss the design features, but focuses on the patina.", "'By arguing that the original purpose has been replaced by the statue's representation of resilience and adaptability due to its patina' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest that the original purpose has been replaced, but rather that the patina adds an additional layer of meaning.", "'By questioning whether the statue's original purpose is still relevant today, given the changes in political and social contexts' is incorrect because Text 2 does not discuss the relevance of the original purpose in the current context."], "id": 23113}]
