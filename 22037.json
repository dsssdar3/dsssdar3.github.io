[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Nanoengineering focuses on developing new materials and devices with high precision at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers in size. By manipulating atoms and molecules, nanoengineers can create materials with unique properties that have diverse applications, such as improved drug delivery systems, stronger and lighter materials, and more efficient energy storage devices. The field is interdisciplinary, combining principles from chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To compare and contrast nanoengineering with other engineering disciplines, such as chemical and electrical engineering", "B": "To discuss the ethical implications of manipulating atoms and molecules in the field of nanoengineering", "C": "To highlight specific achievements in nanoengineering, such as the development of advanced drug delivery systems", "D": "To provide an overview of nanoengineering, its focus on nanoscale materials and devices, and its interdisciplinary nature"}, "explanation": "D: 'To provide an overview of nanoengineering, its focus on nanoscale materials and devices, and its interdisciplinary nature' is the correct answer because the text introduces nanoengineering, its focus on the nanoscale, the manipulation of atoms and molecules, and its interdisciplinary nature.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the ethical implications of manipulating atoms and molecules in the field of nanoengineering' is incorrect because the text does not address ethical implications.", "'To highlight specific achievements in nanoengineering, such as the development of advanced drug delivery systems' is incorrect because the text mentions applications but does not focus on specific achievements.", "'To compare and contrast nanoengineering with other engineering disciplines, such as chemical and electrical engineering' is incorrect because the text does not compare nanoengineering to other disciplines."], "id": 22037}]
