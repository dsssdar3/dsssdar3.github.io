[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "John Dalton, an English chemist and physicist, developed the atomic theory in the early 19th century, which states that all matter is composed of small indivisible particles called atoms. Dalton also discovered that atoms of a particular element are identical in mass and properties, while atoms of different elements have distinct masses and properties. Furthermore, Dalton's research led him to propose that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, which combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To provide a brief overview of John Dalton's contributions to atomic theory and chemistry", "B": "To argue that John Dalton's atomic theory is superior to other competing scientific theories", "C": "To describe the personal life and experiences of John Dalton that led him to develop the atomic theory", "D": "To analyze the impact of John Dalton's atomic theory on modern scientific advancements"}, "explanation": "A: 'To provide a brief overview of John Dalton's contributions to atomic theory and chemistry' is the correct answer because the text focuses on summarizing Dalton's atomic theory, his discovery of the properties of atoms, and his ideas about chemical reactions.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that John Dalton's atomic theory is superior to other competing scientific theories' is incorrect because the text does not compare Dalton's theory to other theories or argue for its superiority.", "'To describe the personal life and experiences of John Dalton that led him to develop the atomic theory' is incorrect because the text focuses on Dalton's scientific contributions, not his personal life or experiences.", "'To analyze the impact of John Dalton's atomic theory on modern scientific advancements' is incorrect because the text does not discuss the effects of Dalton's theory on contemporary science."], "id": 24020}]
