[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "In automotive engineering, the four-stroke engine has become the standard for internal combustion engines, providing power through a series of consecutive piston movements. The four strokes include the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. _______ two-stroke engines still exist and are used in applications such as motorcycles and small utility engines, they are generally considered less efficient and produce more emissions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Although", "B": "In addition", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "A: 'Although' is the correct answer because it shows a contrast between the dominance of four-stroke engines and the existence of two-stroke engines.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In addition' is incorrect because it suggests that two-stroke engines are an extension of the information about four-stroke engines, rather than presenting a contrast.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the information on four-stroke engines and the existence of two-stroke engines.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it indicates similarity between the four-stroke and two-stroke engines, whereas the passage intends to contrast their efficiency and emissions."], "id": 24372}]
