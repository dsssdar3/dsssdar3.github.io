[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer, is best known for his discovery of the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He conducted most of his research at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, where he had access to a powerful 100-inch telescope. _______ Hubble's discoveries challenged the prevailing scientific belief that the universe was static and unchanging, leading to the development of the expanding universe theory.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "As a result", "B": "On the other hand", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "A: 'As a result' is the correct answer because it logically connects Hubble's discoveries and the subsequent effect on the scientific community's understanding of the universe.", "distractor_explanation": ["'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or alternative, which is not appropriate in this context.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between Hubble's work and the previous scientific belief, whereas the passage highlights the impact of his work on the scientific community's understanding.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that Hubble's work is being compared to a similar discovery, which is not mentioned in the passage."], "id": 22536}]
