[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist, was known for his ability to make rough estimates and calculations with remarkable accuracy. This skill led to the development of the \"Fermi problem,\" a type of problem-solving that requires making educated guesses based on limited information. Fermi's approach to problem-solving has inspired many scientists and mathematicians to embrace uncertainty and develop their own intuitive sense of estimation.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The text describes Enrico Fermi's personal life and how it influenced his approach to problem-solving.", "B": "The text highlights Enrico Fermi's estimation skills and the influence of Fermi problems on scientific thinking.", "C": "The text focuses on the history of Fermi problems and their development over time.", "D": "The text explores various techniques used by scientists to solve Fermi problems."}, "explanation": "B: 'The text highlights Enrico Fermi's estimation skills and the influence of Fermi problems on scientific thinking.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses Fermi's ability to make rough estimates and the development of the Fermi problem, which inspired other scientists and mathematicians.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The text describes Enrico Fermi's personal life and how it influenced his approach to problem-solving.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Fermi's personal life.", "'The text focuses on the history of Fermi problems and their development over time.' is incorrect because the passage does not provide a historical overview of Fermi problems.", "'The text explores various techniques used by scientists to solve Fermi problems.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss specific techniques used to solve Fermi problems."], "id": 22380}]
