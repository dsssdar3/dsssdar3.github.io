[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Speed skating, a winter sport that began in the 19th century, has seen tremendous advancements in recent years. The introduction of clap skates in the 1990s led to a significant increase in skaters' speeds, as the new design allows for greater extension and power. Aerodynamic suits, specifically designed to reduce air resistance, have also played a crucial role in enhancing performance. These innovations, coupled with rigorous training programs, have contributed to the continuous breaking of world records in the sport.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To provide an in-depth analysis of the physics behind speed skating equipment", "B": "To argue in favor of traditional speed skating techniques over modern innovations", "C": "To discuss advancements in speed skating and their impact on the sport", "D": "To compare the effectiveness of various training programs for speed skaters"}, "explanation": "C: 'To discuss advancements in speed skating and their impact on the sport' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the introduction of clap skates and aerodynamic suits, and how these innovations, along with rigorous training programs, have led to the continuous breaking of world records.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue in favor of traditional speed skating techniques over modern innovations' is incorrect because the passage highlights the positive impact of modern advancements on the sport, rather than advocating for traditional techniques.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of the physics behind speed skating equipment' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions the benefits of clap skates and aerodynamic suits but does not delve into the physics of the equipment.", "'To compare the effectiveness of various training programs for speed skaters' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions rigorous training programs and does not compare different methods."], "id": 23005}]
