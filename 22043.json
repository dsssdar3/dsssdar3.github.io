[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In the 17th century, Robert Hooke, an English scientist, made significant contributions to various scientific fields. Hooke's work on the development of the compound microscope, for instance, allowed him to examine and describe the microscopic structure of plants, which led to his discovery of plant cells. Additionally, Hooke formulated the law of elasticity, known as Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring is proportional to the displacement caused.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To highlight Robert Hooke's contributions to the scientific fields, specifically in microscopy and elasticity", "B": "To discuss the invention of the compound microscope and its impact on the study of plant cells", "C": "To explain the principles behind Hooke's Law and its applications in various scientific areas", "D": "To provide a comprehensive biography of Robert Hooke's life and his scientific achievements"}, "explanation": "A: 'To highlight Robert Hooke's contributions to the scientific fields, specifically in microscopy and elasticity' is the correct answer because the passage discusses Hooke's work on the compound microscope and his formulation of Hooke's Law, both of which are significant contributions to their respective scientific fields.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the invention of the compound microscope and its impact on the study of plant cells' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions Hooke's work on the compound microscope and does not delve into its overall impact on the study of plant cells.", "'To explain the principles behind Hooke's Law and its applications in various scientific areas' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions Hooke's Law and does not provide a detailed explanation of its principles or applications.", "'To provide a comprehensive biography of Robert Hooke's life and his scientific achievements' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Hooke's specific contributions to microscopy and elasticity, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of his life and achievements."], "id": 22043}]
