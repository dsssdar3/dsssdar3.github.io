[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Rhetorical Synthesis", "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: \u2022 Vertical farming is a method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. \u2022 This agricultural technique can optimize plant growth and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics and aeroponics. \u2022 Vertical farming can lead to increased crop yields and reduced resource usage. \u2022 The implementation of vertical farming can reduce the need for arable land and decrease the distance food travels to reach consumers.", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to emphasize the environmental benefits of vertical farming?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers using soilless farming techniques.", "B": "The implementation of vertical farming can reduce the need for arable land and optimize plant growth.", "C": "Vertical farming can lead to increased crop yields, reduced resource usage, and decreased transportation distances for food.", "D": "The agricultural technique of vertical farming can utilize hydroponics and aeroponics to grow crops in stacked layers."}, "explanation": "C: 'Vertical farming can lead to increased crop yields, reduced resource usage, and decreased transportation distances for food.' is the correct answer because it emphasizes the environmental benefits of vertical farming by mentioning increased yields, reduced resource usage, and decreased transportation distances.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers using soilless farming techniques.' is incorrect because it focuses on the method of vertical farming and does not emphasize the environmental benefits.", "'The implementation of vertical farming can reduce the need for arable land and optimize plant growth.' is incorrect because it only mentions two benefits and does not fully emphasize the environmental benefits.", "'The agricultural technique of vertical farming can utilize hydroponics and aeroponics to grow crops in stacked layers.' is incorrect because it focuses on the methods used in vertical farming and does not emphasize the environmental benefits."], "id": 21224}]
