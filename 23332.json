[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "In control systems engineering, the stability of a system is crucial for ensuring desired performance. One widely used method to analyze a system's stability is the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, which can determine the number of ________ roots in the characteristic equation without explicitly solving it.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "imaginary", "B": "right-half plane", "C": "recursive", "D": "compartmentalized"}, "explanation": "B: 'right-half plane' is the correct answer because the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is specifically used to determine the number of right-half plane roots in the characteristic equation, which are directly related to the stability of a system.", "distractor_explanation": ["'imaginary' is incorrect because imaginary roots do not necessarily imply instability.", "'recursive' is incorrect because it is not related to the roots of the characteristic equation in control systems engineering.", "'compartmentalized' is incorrect because it is not related to the roots or stability analysis of a control system."], "id": 23332}]
