[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Rhetorical Synthesis", "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: \u2022 Petroleum engineering involves the extraction of oil and natural gas. \u2022 Enhanced oil recovery techniques can increase the amount of oil extracted from a reservoir. \u2022 One such technique is carbon dioxide (CO2) injection. \u2022 CO2 injection works by dissolving the CO2 in the oil, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to pump out.", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to describe a technique in petroleum engineering?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Petroleum engineering involves the extraction of oil and natural gas using carbon dioxide.", "B": "Carbon dioxide injection, an enhanced oil recovery technique in petroleum engineering, reduces oil viscosity and increases extraction efficiency.", "C": "Enhanced oil recovery involves using carbon dioxide to dissolve oil.", "D": "Carbon dioxide injection is a technique used in various engineering fields."}, "explanation": "B: 'Carbon dioxide injection, an enhanced oil recovery technique in petroleum engineering, reduces oil viscosity and increases extraction efficiency.' is the correct answer because it accurately and effectively uses the information from the notes to describe a technique in petroleum engineering.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Petroleum engineering involves the extraction of oil and natural gas using carbon dioxide.' is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the role of carbon dioxide injection in enhanced oil recovery.", "'Enhanced oil recovery involves using carbon dioxide to dissolve oil.' is incorrect because it does not provide enough information about how the technique works.", "'Carbon dioxide injection is a technique used in various engineering fields.' is incorrect because it does not specifically relate the technique to petroleum engineering and its purpose in enhancing oil extraction."], "id": 23188}]
