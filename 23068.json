[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Hydroponic farming is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water solutions as the primary source of sustenance. This modern technique is highly efficient and is becoming increasingly popular due to its potential for saving both space and resources. However, some critics argue that hydroponic farming is not as sustainable as traditional soil-based agriculture, citing concerns about water usage and waste management.", "text_2": "In response to concerns about sustainability in hydroponic farming, researchers have developed innovative techniques to address these issues. One such method is the use of recirculating systems, which significantly reduce water consumption by recycling nutrient solutions. Additionally, integrating waste management systems, such as composting and vermiculture, can help to mitigate the environmental impact of hydroponic farms."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to the concerns about sustainability discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By asserting that hydroponic farming is inherently more sustainable than traditional farming methods due to its efficient use of space and resources.", "B": "By suggesting that the benefits of hydroponic farming, such as increased crop yields and reduced land use, outweigh the concerns about sustainability.", "C": "By addressing the concerns about water usage and waste management through the implementation of recirculating systems and integrated waste management techniques.", "D": "By arguing that the environmental impact of hydroponic farming is negligible compared to the large-scale ecological consequences of soil-based agriculture."}, "explanation": "C: 'By addressing the concerns about water usage and waste management through the implementation of recirculating systems and integrated waste management techniques.' is the correct answer because Text 2 specifically mentions the development of innovative techniques, such as recirculating systems and integrated waste management, to address the concerns about sustainability raised in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that hydroponic farming is inherently more sustainable than traditional farming methods due to its efficient use of space and resources.' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on addressing specific concerns rather than making a broad assertion about sustainability.", "'By suggesting that the benefits of hydroponic farming, such as increased crop yields and reduced land use, outweigh the concerns about sustainability.' is incorrect because Text 2 does not make a comparison between the benefits and concerns of hydroponic farming.", "'By arguing that the environmental impact of hydroponic farming is negligible compared to the large-scale ecological consequences of soil-based agriculture.' is incorrect because Text 2 does not make a direct comparison between the environmental impact of hydroponic farming and soil-based agriculture."], "id": 23068}]
