She argues that by imposing a cost on carbon emissions, it would provide an incentive for companies to shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, the revenue generated from the tax could be used to fund climate change mitigation efforts.", "text_2": "Environmentalist Brian Smith critiques the idea of a carbon tax, stating that such a policy may disproportionately affect low-income households. He points out that the additional costs for energy and goods as a result of the carbon tax would likely be passed on to consumers, which could lead to increased financial strain for those who are economically vulnerable."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Brian Smith (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201ceffectiveness of carbon tax\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By agreeing with Sarah Johnson's view and suggesting that a carbon tax would be beneficial for the environment", "B": "By disputing the notion that a carbon tax would create incentives for companies to adopt cleaner energy sources", "C": "By suggesting that a carbon tax would not generate enough revenue to fund significant climate change mitigation efforts", "D": "By raising concerns about the potential negative impact of the carbon tax on low-income households and economic inequality"}, "explanation": "D: 'By raising concerns about the potential negative impact of the carbon tax on low-income households and economic inequality' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses Brian Smith's critique of the carbon tax, specifically focusing on its potential negative effects on low-income households.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By agreeing with Sarah Johnson's view and suggesting that a carbon tax would be beneficial for the environment' is incorrect because Brian Smith critiques the idea of a carbon tax in Text 2.", "'By disputing the notion that a carbon tax would create incentives for companies to adopt cleaner energy sources' is incorrect because Text 2 does not specifically challenge the incentive aspect of the carbon tax.", "'By suggesting that a carbon tax would not generate enough revenue to fund significant climate change mitigation efforts' is incorrect because Text 2 does not discuss revenue generation or climate change mitigation funding."], "id": 23105}]
