It originated from the Caribbean coast and has since spread to various regions in Colombia. Traditional cumbia is characterized by its distinctive instrumentation, primarily featuring drums, maracas, and the guacharaca. The dance itself is a sensual display of courtship, with men and women performing intricate footwork as they circle each other.", "text_2": "In recent years, the Colombian cumbia has experienced a resurgence in popularity, both in Colombia and internationally. This revival is attributed to contemporary musicians incorporating cumbia rhythms and melodies into their work, creating a fusion of traditional and modern sounds. While some critics argue that this dilutes the authenticity of the original cumbia, others believe it helps preserve the cultural significance of the dance and allows it to evolve with the times."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the critics (Text 2) most likely respond to the popularity of traditional Colombian cumbia discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": " By praising the fusion of traditional and modern sounds in contemporary cumbia", "B": " By expressing concern that the resurgence of cumbia may lead to cultural homogenization", "C": " By dismissing the importance of traditional cumbia due to its limited scope and regional influence", "D": " By arguing that the incorporation of cumbia into contemporary music dilutes the authenticity of the original dance and its cultural roots"}, "explanation": "D: 'By arguing that the incorporation of cumbia into contemporary music dilutes the authenticity of the original dance and its cultural roots' is the correct answer because Text 2 states that some critics argue that the fusion of traditional and modern sounds in contemporary cumbia dilutes the authenticity of the original dance.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By praising the fusion of traditional and modern sounds in contemporary cumbia' is incorrect because the question asks about the critics' response, not the supporters' response.", "'By expressing concern that the resurgence of cumbia may lead to cultural homogenization' is incorrect because neither text discusses cultural homogenization as a concern.", "'By dismissing the importance of traditional cumbia due to its limited scope and regional influence' is incorrect because the texts do not mention any dismissal of the importance of traditional cumbia."], "id": 21099}]
