[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Niels Bohr, a renowned physicist, made significant contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. In 1913, he proposed a model of the atom, explaining the behavior of electrons in orbits around the nucleus. Later, Bohr expanded on this model by developing the concept of complementarity, which maintains that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This laid the foundation for the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which Bohr co-developed with other prominent physicists.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the development of the complementarity concept and its role in quantum mechanics", "B": "To emphasize the importance of the Copenhagen interpretation in modern physics", "C": "To highlight Niels Bohr's seminal contributions to atomic structure and quantum mechanics", "D": "To provide a detailed analysis of Niels Bohr's 1913 model of the atom"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight Niels Bohr's seminal contributions to atomic structure and quantum mechanics' is the correct answer because the text discusses Bohr's work on the atomic model and his role in developing the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To emphasize the importance of the Copenhagen interpretation in modern physics' is incorrect because the text focuses on Niels Bohr's contributions, not solely on the Copenhagen interpretation.", "'To discuss the development of the complementarity concept and its role in quantum mechanics' is incorrect because the text briefly mentions complementarity but does not delve into its development or role in detail.", "'To provide a detailed analysis of Niels Bohr's 1913 model of the atom' is incorrect because the text briefly introduces the model but does not provide an in-depth analysis."], "id": 22005}]
