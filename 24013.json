[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Subsidies are financial incentives provided by governments to promote specific industries or activities. They can take various forms, such as tax breaks, grants, or cheap loans. While subsidies can stimulate economic growth and create jobs, they can also lead to market distortions and exacerbate income inequality. Critics argue that subsidies often benefit the wealthy, who can afford to invest in subsidized industries, while the poor bear the brunt of the costs through higher taxes or reduced public services.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To provide an overview of subsidies and discuss their potential benefits and drawbacks", "B": "To argue in favor of eliminating all subsidies due to their harmful effects on income inequality", "C": "To explain the specific mechanisms by which subsidies can lead to market distortions", "D": "To explore the history of subsidies and how they have evolved over time"}, "explanation": "A: 'To provide an overview of subsidies and discuss their potential benefits and drawbacks' is the correct answer because the passage briefly defines subsidies, mentions various forms they can take, and discusses both the positive and negative aspects of their use.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue in favor of eliminating all subsidies due to their harmful effects on income inequality' is incorrect because the passage presents both benefits and drawbacks of subsidies, not just their harmful effects.", "'To explain the specific mechanisms by which subsidies can lead to market distortions' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions market distortions as one of the drawbacks of subsidies, without delving into specific mechanisms.", "'To explore the history of subsidies and how they have evolved over time' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the general concept of subsidies and their effects, rather than their historical development."], "id": 24013}]
