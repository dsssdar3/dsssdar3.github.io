[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Solar energy engineer Alice Johnson has developed an innovative technique for tracking the efficiency of photovoltaic solar panels. She uses a complex algorithm that continuously analyzes energy output and identifies fluctuations in performance. According to Johnson, this method allows engineers to detect issues with solar panels earlier and improve overall energy production.", "text_2": "In contrast, solar energy engineer Bob Smith argues that monitoring the temperature of solar panels is a more effective way to assess their efficiency. Smith's method involves placing sensors on the panels to measure heat output, which directly correlates with energy production. He claims that temperature monitoring is a simpler and more reliable method for identifying issues with solar panel performance."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Bob Smith (Text 2) most likely respond to the technique discussed by Alice Johnson in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": " By agreeing that the algorithm-based method is superior due to its ability to constantly analyze energy output", "B": " By suggesting that both temperature monitoring and algorithm-based methods should be combined for optimal results", "C": " By questioning the accuracy of the complex algorithm and its ability to detect fluctuations in solar panel performance", "D": " By asserting that temperature monitoring is a simpler and more reliable method for assessing solar panel efficiency"}, "explanation": "D: 'By asserting that temperature monitoring is a simpler and more reliable method for assessing solar panel efficiency' is the correct answer because Text 2 states that Bob Smith claims temperature monitoring is simpler and more reliable for identifying issues with solar panel performance.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By agreeing that the algorithm-based method is superior due to its ability to constantly analyze energy output' is incorrect because Text 2 shows Bob Smith advocating for temperature monitoring, not agreeing with Alice Johnson's method.", "'By suggesting that both temperature monitoring and algorithm-based methods should be combined for optimal results' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention combining both methods.", "'By questioning the accuracy of the complex algorithm and its ability to detect fluctuations in solar panel performance' is incorrect because Text 2 does not specifically question the accuracy of Alice Johnson's algorithm, but rather advocates for a simpler and more reliable method."], "id": 23064}]
