[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Leon Trotsky, a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, played a significant role in the early years of the Soviet Union. His leadership during the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War helped establish the Soviet state. However, Trotsky's influence waned as Joseph Stalin rose to power in the 1920s, ultimately leading to Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union.", "text_2": "Although Trotsky's contributions to the Russian Revolution were significant, his later years were marked by a series of defeats and disillusionment. Trotsky's opposition to Stalin and the bureaucracy of the Soviet state led to his eventual downfall. Despite his setbacks, Trotsky remained an influential figure in leftist circles, advocating for a global socialist revolution until his assassination in 1940."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the 'waning influence' of Trotsky discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": " By emphasizing the importance of Trotsky's early contributions to the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet state.", "B": " By asserting that Trotsky's waning influence was primarily due to external factors, such as the rise of fascist powers in Europe.", "C": " By suggesting that Trotsky's waning influence was not critical, as his ideas remained influential in leftist circles long after his exile.", "D": " By attributing Trotsky's diminishing influence to his opposition to Stalin and the bureaucracy of the Soviet state, leading to his eventual downfall."}, "explanation": "D: 'By attributing Trotsky's diminishing influence to his opposition to Stalin and the bureaucracy of the Soviet state, leading to his eventual downfall' is the correct answer because Text 2 explicitly mentions that Trotsky's opposition to Stalin and the Soviet state bureaucracy led to his downfall.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing the importance of Trotsky's early contributions to the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet state' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses more on his later years and defeats.", "'By asserting that Trotsky's waning influence was primarily due to external factors, such as the rise of fascist powers in Europe' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention any external factors contributing to his diminishing influence.", "'By suggesting that Trotsky's waning influence was not critical, as his ideas remained influential in leftist circles long after his exile' is incorrect because although Text 2 acknowledges his continued influence in leftist circles, it also emphasizes his downfall due to his opposition to Stalin and the Soviet bureaucracy."], "id": 21059}]
