[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Astronomer Samuel Evanson studied Johannes Kepler's approach to planetary motion, emphasizing Kepler's focus on mathematical laws governing the movement of celestial bodies. Evanson argues that Kepler's revolutionary laws paved the way for modern astronomy by accurately predicting planetary orbits.", "text_2": "Historian Laura Gibbons, while acknowledging Kepler's contributions, asserts that his laws were based on the observations of Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer.
