[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Street luge, a gravity-powered extreme sport, involves riding a wheeled sled down a paved road. Competitors lie on their backs, feet first, and steer the sled by shifting their weight. The sport has evolved since its inception, and modern street luge sleds now ______ specialized braking systems for increased control and safety.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "will have", "B": "feature", "C": "having", "D": "to feature"}, "explanation": "B: 'feature' is the correct answer because it provides a finite present tense verb that matches the tense of the other verbs in the passage and properly indicates the current state of modern street luge sleds.", "distractor_explanation": ["'will have' is incorrect because the future tense does not match the tense of the other verbs in the passage and implies that modern sleds do not yet have specialized braking systems.", "'having' is incorrect because it is a nonfinite verb form that does not provide a main verb for the clause.", "'to feature' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive does not supply the main clause with a finite verb."], "id": 24092}]
