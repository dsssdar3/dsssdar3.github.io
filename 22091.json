[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Economist John Robinson argues that an ideal market economy requires perfect competition, where numerous small firms compete for consumer demand. According to Robinson, this ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and prevents market power concentration in the hands of few.", "text_2": "In contrast, economist Jane Smith posits that market economies can still function effectively in the presence of imperfect competition.
