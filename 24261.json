[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician from India, made groundbreaking contributions to the field of mathematics. Despite receiving no formal training in mathematics, Ramanujan's innate genius allowed him to develop extraordinary mathematical formulas and equations. His work in number theory and mathematical analysis attracted the attention of British mathematician G.H. Hardy, who invited Ramanujan to Cambridge University. Ramanujan's collaboration with Hardy led to the discovery of many new mathematical concepts.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "The exceptional mathematical abilities of Srinivasa Ramanujan and his collaboration with G.H. Hardy", "B": "The importance of formal education in the development of mathematical genius", "C": "The specific mathematical concepts discovered by Srinivasa Ramanujan", "D": "G.H. Hardy's influence on the career of Srinivasa Ramanujan"}, "explanation": "A: 'The exceptional mathematical abilities of Srinivasa Ramanujan and his collaboration with G.H. Hardy' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Ramanujan's innate genius and his work with Hardy, which led to the discovery of new mathematical concepts.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The importance of formal education in the development of mathematical genius' is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Ramanujan's achievements despite his lack of formal education.", "'The specific mathematical concepts discovered by Srinivasa Ramanujan' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the details of Ramanujan's discoveries.", "'G.H. Hardy's influence on the career of Srinivasa Ramanujan' is incorrect because the passage highlights Ramanujan's collaboration with Hardy but does not focus on Hardy's influence."], "id": 24261}]
