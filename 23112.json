[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Joseph Priestley, an 18th-century English scientist, is best known for his discovery of oxygen. He also made significant contributions to the understanding of electricity and chemistry. Priestley's work laid the groundwork for modern scientific methods and helped establish a clear distinction between elements and compounds.", "text_2": "Priestley's experiments involving the isolation of various gases, including oxygen, played a crucial role in the development of modern chemistry. His work on electricity, however, has been overshadowed by his contemporaries, such as Benjamin Franklin. Priestley's discoveries in both fields nonetheless made a lasting impact on the scientific community."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the statement about Priestley's contributions to electricity and chemistry in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging Priestley's contributions to both fields but noting that his work on electricity has been overshadowed by that of his contemporaries", "B": "By arguing that Priestley's discovery of oxygen was a minor achievement compared to his contemporaries' work in the field of chemistry", "C": "By asserting that Priestley's work on electricity was more significant and groundbreaking than his work on chemistry", "D": "By suggesting that Priestley's work on electricity and chemistry was less impactful than his development of modern scientific methods"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging Priestley's contributions to both fields but noting that his work on electricity has been overshadowed by that of his contemporaries' is the correct answer because it aligns with the information presented in Text 2. Text 2 recognizes the importance of Priestley\u2019s work in both fields while also mentioning that his work on electricity has been overshadowed.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that Priestley's work on electricity was more significant and groundbreaking than his work on chemistry' is incorrect because Text 2 does not make this claim, but rather acknowledges the importance of his work in both fields.", "'By arguing that Priestley's discovery of oxygen was a minor achievement compared to his contemporaries' work in the field of chemistry' is incorrect because Text 2 does not compare Priestley's achievements to those of his contemporaries.", "'By suggesting that Priestley's work on electricity and chemistry was less impactful than his development of modern scientific methods' is incorrect because Text 2 does not make this comparison, but does acknowledge his contributions to both fields."], "id": 23112}]
