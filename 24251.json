[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Computer vision, an emerging field in computer science, focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information. By mimicking the human visual system, computer vision technology can process images, detect objects, and recognize patterns. Applications range from facial recognition systems to self-driving cars. Despite its potential, the field faces challenges such as accurately detecting objects in complex and dynamic environments.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "The primary focus is on the challenges faced by computer vision technology in accurately detecting objects and patterns.", "B": "The primary focus is on the human visual system and how it has inspired the development of advanced computer vision technologies.", "C": "The main idea discusses the numerous applications of computer vision and how they have revolutionized modern technology.", "D": "The main idea focuses on computer vision as a field that aims to replicate human visual processing for various applications, despite facing challenges."}, "explanation": "D: 'The main idea focuses on computer vision as a field that aims to replicate human visual processing for various applications, despite facing challenges.' is the correct answer because it encompasses the central theme of the passage, which describes computer vision, its applications, and the challenges it faces.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The primary focus is on the human visual system and how it has inspired the development of advanced computer vision technologies.' is incorrect because the passage does mention the human visual system as an inspiration, but it is not the main focus of the text.", "'The main idea discusses the numerous applications of computer vision and how they have revolutionized modern technology.' is incorrect because, while the passage does mention applications, it is not the primary focus.", "'The primary focus is on the challenges faced by computer vision technology in accurately detecting objects and patterns.' is incorrect because the challenges are mentioned, but they are not the main focus of the passage."], "id": 24251}]
