Over the course of his four voyages, Columbus uncovered the existence of the Americas and unintentionally facilitated contact between Europe and the New World. While his discoveries were groundbreaking, they also led to the colonization and exploitation of indigenous people. In recent years, Columbus's legacy has been reevaluated, with many critics arguing that his actions contributed to the suffering of native populations.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To detail the specific routes and methods Columbus used during his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean", "B": "To provide an overview of Christopher Columbus's voyages and their consequences, both positive and negative", "C": "To argue in favor of reevaluating Columbus's legacy and removing his statues from public spaces", "D": "To explore the personal motivations and ambitions that drove Columbus to embark on his world-changing journeys"}, "explanation": "B: 'To provide an overview of Christopher Columbus's voyages and their consequences, both positive and negative' is the correct answer because the passage gives a brief summary of Columbus's discovery of the Americas, its impact on the world, and the recent debate surrounding his legacy.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To detail the specific routes and methods Columbus used during his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the technical aspects of Columbus's voyages.", "'To argue in favor of reevaluating Columbus's legacy and removing his statues from public spaces' is incorrect because the passage only mentions the reevaluation of his legacy, but does not argue for a specific action.", "'To explore the personal motivations and ambitions that drove Columbus to embark on his world-changing journeys' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Columbus's personal motivations or ambitions."], "id": 22027}]
