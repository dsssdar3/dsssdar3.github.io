The debate over digital privacy continues, as people grapple with the balance between personal privacy and the benefits of data sharing.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To highlight the benefits of data sharing and why it outweighs the need for personal privacy", "B": "To provide an overview of government regulations surrounding digital privacy and their effectiveness", "C": "To discuss the growing concern of digital privacy in the face of technological advancements and its implications", "D": "To emphasize the role of corporations in exploiting personal data and neglecting user privacy concerns"}, "explanation": "C: 'To discuss the growing concern of digital privacy in the face of technological advancements and its implications' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the concern around digital privacy, mentioning the unawareness of users, the exploitation by companies, and the differing approaches of governments.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide an overview of government regulations surrounding digital privacy and their effectiveness' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions government regulations as one aspect of the digital privacy debate.", "'To highlight the benefits of data sharing and why it outweighs the need for personal privacy' is incorrect because the passage does not argue in favor of data sharing or suggest that its benefits outweigh the need for privacy.", "'To emphasize the role of corporations in exploiting personal data and neglecting user privacy concerns' is incorrect because, although the passage mentions corporate exploitation, it does not solely focus on this aspect of digital privacy."], "id": 22034}]
