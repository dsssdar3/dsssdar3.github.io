[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Coral reef conservationists, like Dr. Emma Smith, argue that creating marine protected areas (MPAs) is the most effective method for preserving coral reefs. By restricting human activities and fishing within these zones, coral reefs have a better chance of recovering from the damage caused by climate change and pollution.", "text_2": "In contrast, biologist Dr. James Martinez believes that the key to coral reef conservation is not solely through the establishment of MPAs.
