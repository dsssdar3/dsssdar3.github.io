[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "James Clerk Maxwell, a renowned physicist, developed the theory of electromagnetic radiation. This groundbreaking work unified the theories of electricity, magnetism, and light, illustrating that they are all interconnected phenomena. Maxwell's equations, as they are now known, form the basis of modern physics and have had a profound impact on the development of technology, such as wireless communication and radar systems.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "The passage emphasizes the role of Maxwell's equations in the development of advanced technology.", "B": "The passage focuses on the importance of wireless communication and radar systems in modern society.", "C": "The text primarily discusses the interconnectedness of electricity, magnetism, and light as separate phenomena.", "D": "The text highlights the significance of James Clerk Maxwell's contributions to the understanding of electromagnetic radiation."}, "explanation": "D: 'The text highlights the significance of James Clerk Maxwell's contributions to the understanding of electromagnetic radiation.' is the correct answer because the passage emphasizes Maxwell's development of the theory of electromagnetic radiation and the impact it had on the field of physics and technology.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The passage focuses on the importance of wireless communication and radar systems in modern society.' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the impact of Maxwell's work on these technologies.", "'The text primarily discusses the interconnectedness of electricity, magnetism, and light as separate phenomena.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on Maxwell's contribution to unifying these phenomena under the theory of electromagnetic radiation.", "'The passage emphasizes the role of Maxwell's equations in the development of advanced technology.' is incorrect because the passage does not primarily focus on technology, but rather on Maxwell's scientific contributions and their impact on the understanding of electromagnetic radiation."], "id": 24266}]
