[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Johannes Kepler, a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution, is best known for his laws of planetary motion. These laws describe the motion of planets around the sun in elliptical orbits. Kepler's work was based on the observations made by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. _____ Kepler was also a mathematician and made significant contributions to the field of geometry, including the development of Kepler's solids.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand,", "B": "In contrast,", "C": "However,", "D": "Moreover,"}, "explanation": "D: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it shows that the information about Kepler's contributions to mathematics and geometry adds to the previous information about his work on planetary motion.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests a contradiction or difference between Kepler's work on planetary motion and his work in mathematics and geometry, which is not the case.", "'However' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between the two aspects of Kepler's work, when in fact they are complementary.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative or contrast to Kepler's work on planetary motion, when the passage is discussing an additional area of Kepler's work."], "id": 22582}]
