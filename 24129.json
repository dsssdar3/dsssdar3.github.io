[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Rhetorical Synthesis", "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: \u2022 Food Processing Engineering involves the application of engineering principles to food production and distribution. \u2022 Pasteurization is a widely used process in Food Processing Engineering to increase the shelf life of products. \u2022 High-Pressure Processing (HPP) is an alternative method to pasteurization, which retains more nutrients in the food. \u2022 HPP uses pressure instead of heat to inactivate microorganisms and enzymes in food products.", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to describe an advantage of High-Pressure Processing over pasteurization?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "High-Pressure Processing, an alternative method to pasteurization in Food Processing Engineering, retains more nutrients in the food due to using pressure instead of heat.", "B": "Pasteurization is a widely used process in Food Processing Engineering, but High-Pressure Processing is an alternative method.", "C": "Food Processing Engineering involves the application of engineering principles to food production and distribution, including pasteurization and High-Pressure Processing.", "D": "Both pasteurization and High-Pressure Processing are methods used in Food Processing Engineering to increase the shelf life of products."}, "explanation": "A: 'High-Pressure Processing, an alternative method to pasteurization in Food Processing Engineering, retains more nutrients in the food due to using pressure instead of heat.' is the correct answer because it emphasizes the advantage of HPP over pasteurization by mentioning the retention of more nutrients in the food.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Food Processing Engineering involves the application of engineering principles to food production and distribution, including pasteurization and High-Pressure Processing.' is incorrect because it does not emphasize the advantage of HPP over pasteurization.", "'Pasteurization is a widely used process in Food Processing Engineering, but High-Pressure Processing is an alternative method.' is incorrect because it does not explain the advantage of HPP over pasteurization.", "'Both pasteurization and High-Pressure Processing are methods used in Food Processing Engineering to increase the shelf life of products.' is incorrect because it does not describe the advantage of HPP over pasteurization."], "id": 24129}]
