[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Transportation engineers often rely on traffic simulations to predict the flow of vehicles through a network of streets and highways. The microscopic simulation model, which ______ individual vehicles and their interactions, provides the most detailed and accurate assessment of traffic conditions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "have been tracking", "B": "will track", "C": "tracks", "D": "tracked"}, "explanation": "C: 'tracks' is the correct answer because it maintains the present tense used throughout the passage and provides a finite verb to describe the action of the microscopic simulation model.", "distractor_explanation": ["'have been tracking' is incorrect because it introduces an unnecessary present perfect progressive tense that does not fit the context.", "'will track' is incorrect because it introduces an unnecessary future tense that does not fit the context.", "'tracked' is incorrect because it introduces an unnecessary past tense that does not fit the context."], "id": 23131}]
