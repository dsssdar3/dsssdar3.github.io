[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Dmitri Mendeleev, a 19th-century Russian chemist, is best known for creating the periodic table of elements. By arranging the elements in order of increasing atomic mass, Mendeleev discovered that elements with similar properties tended to recur periodically. This insight allowed him to predict the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been refined and updated, but it remains one of the most important tools in the field of chemistry and a key foundation for understanding the behavior of elements.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To highlight Dmitri Mendeleev's significant contribution to chemistry through the creation of the periodic table", "B": "To provide a comprehensive biography of Dmitri Mendeleev's life and career as a chemist", "C": "To explore the numerous ways in which the periodic table has been refined and updated since its inception", "D": "To debate the relative importance of Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table in comparison to other scientific tools"}, "explanation": "A: 'To highlight Dmitri Mendeleev's significant contribution to chemistry through the creation of the periodic table' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on Mendeleev's creation of the periodic table and its importance in the field of chemistry.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a comprehensive biography of Dmitri Mendeleev's life and career as a chemist' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions Mendeleev's background and focuses on his creation of the periodic table.", "'To explore the numerous ways in which the periodic table has been refined and updated since its inception' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions that the periodic table has been refined and updated, but does not go into detail about these changes.", "'To debate the relative importance of Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table in comparison to other scientific tools' is incorrect because the passage does not compare the periodic table to other scientific tools, but rather discusses its importance in chemistry."], "id": 23016}]
