Mendeleev created the periodic table of elements, which greatly enhanced the understanding of elements and their properties. He also predicted the properties of undiscovered elements with remarkable accuracy, earning him international recognition and admiration among his peers. Mendeleev's work laid the foundation for modern chemistry and continues to inspire scientists in their quest for knowledge.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To discuss Mendeleev's early life and how his upbringing led him to the field of chemistry", "B": "To highlight Mendeleev's contributions to chemistry, specifically the periodic table and predicting undiscovered elements' properties", "C": "To compare Mendeleev's periodic table to other versions created by various scientists throughout history", "D": "To focus on the controversies and disagreements Mendeleev faced throughout his career as a chemist"}, "explanation": "B: 'To highlight Mendeleev's contributions to chemistry, specifically the periodic table and predicting undiscovered elements' properties' is the correct answer because the text mainly discusses Mendeleev's accomplishments in creating the periodic table and predicting properties of undiscovered elements.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss Mendeleev's early life and how his upbringing led him to the field of chemistry' is incorrect because the text does not mention Mendeleev's early life or upbringing.", "'To compare Mendeleev's periodic table to other versions created by various scientists throughout history' is incorrect because the text does not discuss other versions of the periodic table.", "'To focus on the controversies and disagreements Mendeleev faced throughout his career as a chemist' is incorrect because the text does not mention any controversies or disagreements."], "id": 21053}]
