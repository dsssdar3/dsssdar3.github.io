[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Materials handling engineer, Anna Thompson, has developed a new method for transporting heavy materials using air cushion technology. The method involves placing the materials on a platform with air cushions underneath, which reduces friction and allows for easier movement of the materials across various surfaces. This method has been praised for its potential to improve efficiency and reduce physical strain on workers.", "text_2": "Another materials handling engineer, John Kim, has been researching the use of magnetic levitation as a means to transport heavy materials. Magnetic levitation uses magnetic fields to lift and move objects, reducing the friction between the object and the surface. Kim's research has shown that this method can lead to increased efficiency and reduced physical strain on workers."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would John Kim (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201cair cushion technology\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By arguing that air cushion technology is outdated and inefficient compared to magnetic levitation", "B": "By suggesting that Anna Thompson's method is overly complicated and difficult to implement on a large scale", "C": "By acknowledging the potential benefits of air cushion technology, but emphasizing the advantages of magnetic levitation", "D": "By claiming that air cushion technology is ineffective at reducing physical strain on workers and improving efficiency"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging the potential benefits of air cushion technology, but emphasizing the advantages of magnetic levitation' is the correct answer because both texts discuss methods for transporting heavy materials that aim to reduce friction and physical strain on workers, but John Kim's research focuses on the benefits of magnetic levitation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that air cushion technology is outdated and inefficient compared to magnetic levitation' is incorrect because John Kim's research does not mention the relative age or efficiency of air cushion technology.", "'By suggesting that Anna Thompson's method is overly complicated and difficult to implement on a large scale' is incorrect because there is no mention of implementation difficulty in either text.", "'By claiming that air cushion technology is ineffective at reducing physical strain on workers and improving efficiency' is incorrect because Text 1 praises the potential benefits of air cushion technology."], "id": 21101}]
