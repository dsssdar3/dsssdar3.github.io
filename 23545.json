The US achieved a swift victory over Spain, and as a result, gained control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. _______ the Teller Amendment of 1898 declared that the US would not annex Cuba and that it would grant independence to the island after the conflict.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "In addition", "B": "Similarly", "C": "However", "D": "Consequently"}, "explanation": "C: 'However' is the correct answer because it indicates a contrast between the US expansionist agenda and the Teller Amendment's declaration of not annexing Cuba.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it suggests a similarity between the US expansionist agenda and the Teller Amendment, but there is a contrast.", "'In addition' is incorrect because it suggests that the Teller Amendment adds to the US expansionist agenda, but it actually contrasts with it.", "'Consequently' is incorrect because it implies that the Teller Amendment is a direct result of the US expansionist agenda, but the passage highlights a contrast between the two."], "id": 23545}]
