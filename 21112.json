[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Luge is an extreme winter sport in which athletes descend down an icy track using a small sled. The sled's design is crucial for a successful run, as it directly impacts the athlete's control and speed. Some lugers believe that using a heavier sled can help them gain momentum and achieve faster speeds.", "text_2": "In contrast, other lugers argue that a lighter sled can provide more precise control and maneuverability on the track. They claim that the increased control outweighs any potential speed advantages gained from a heavier sled. According to these athletes, success in luge competitions relies more on skillful navigation of the course than on raw speed alone."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would lugers supporting lighter sleds (Text 2) most likely respond to the idea of using a heavier sled (Text 1)?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": " By acknowledging that heavier sleds might be advantageous in certain situations but maintaining that lighter sleds are generally more versatile", "B": " By suggesting that heavier sleds are outdated and that modern technology has made lighter sleds the superior choice", "C": " By emphasizing that the increased control and maneuverability offered by lighter sleds outweigh the potential speed advantages of heavier sleds", "D": " By proposing that there should be separate luge competitions for those using heavier sleds and those using lighter sleds"}, "explanation": "C: 'By emphasizing that the increased control and maneuverability offered by lighter sleds outweigh the potential speed advantages of heavier sleds' is the correct answer because it aligns with the argument presented in Text 2 that lighter sleds provide more precise control and maneuverability on the track.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By acknowledging that heavier sleds might be advantageous in certain situations but maintaining that lighter sleds are generally more versatile' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the advantages of lighter sleds without acknowledging the potential benefits of heavier sleds.", "'By suggesting that heavier sleds are outdated and that modern technology has made lighter sleds the superior choice' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention technological advancements.", "'By proposing that there should be separate luge competitions for those using heavier sleds and those using lighter sleds' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest creating separate competitions."], "id": 21112}]
