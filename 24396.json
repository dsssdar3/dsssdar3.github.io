Their prices fluctuate based on factors like supply, demand, and geopolitical events. For example, if a major oil-producing country experiences political turmoil, it could disrupt the supply of oil and cause prices to rise. _______ gold prices are often seen as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty, leading investors to buy gold when the economy is struggling.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Nevertheless,", "B": "In contrast,", "C": "Similarly,", "D": "On the other hand,"}, "explanation": "C: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it shows that gold prices, like oil prices, are also influenced by external factors.", "distractor_explanation": ["'In contrast' is incorrect because it would imply that gold prices behave differently from oil prices, when the passage is actually showing a similarity between the two.", "'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it would imply that the relationship between gold prices and economic uncertainty is a contrast or exception to the previous point, while it is actually a similar example.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it would imply that gold prices are being presented as an alternative or contrast to oil prices, when the passage is actually showing a similarity between the two."], "id": 24396}]
