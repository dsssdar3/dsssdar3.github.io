[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Boundaries", "passage": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was an agreement between Spain and Portugal to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe. The two nations agreed to a boundary line that ran from the North Pole to the South Pole, passing through a point about 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. This line allowed Spain to claim land to the west of the line, while Portugal could claim land to the ______ of the line.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "north", "B": "south", "C": "up", "D": "east"}, "explanation": "D: 'east' is the correct answer because the passage discusses a boundary line that separates the lands claimed by Spain and Portugal. Spain is allowed to claim land to the west, so logically, Portugal would claim land to the east of the line.", "distractor_explanation": ["'north' is incorrect because it does not provide the correct direction in relation to the boundary line.", "'south' is incorrect because it also does not provide the correct direction in relation to the boundary line.", "'up' is incorrect because it is not a valid direction for claiming land."], "id": 24184}]
