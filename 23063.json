[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "During the Age of Discovery, navigators relied on celestial navigation to traverse the vast oceans. This method required the use of instruments such as astrolabes and sextants, which measured the altitude of celestial bodies to determine latitude. Despite its widespread use, celestial navigation often proved inaccurate, leading to navigational errors and shipwrecks.", "text_2": "Cartographer Sophia Martinez and her team have recently discovered that the inaccuracies in celestial navigation during the Age of Discovery can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the Earth's magnetic field. Their research reveals that navigators were unaware of the significant impact the Earth's magnetic field had on their instruments, resulting in miscalculations and errors."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Sophia Martinez and her team (Text 2) most likely respond to the inaccuracies in celestial navigation discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that navigators should have relied on alternative methods of navigation, such as dead reckoning or the use of maps", "B": "By arguing that the inaccuracies were primarily due to poor craftsmanship of the navigation instruments, such as astrolabes and sextants", "C": "By attributing the inaccuracies to a lack of understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on navigation instruments", "D": "By proposing that the inaccuracies were unavoidable due to the limitations of technology available during the Age of Discovery"}, "explanation": "C: 'By attributing the inaccuracies to a lack of understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on navigation instruments' is the correct answer because Text 2 states that Sophia Martinez and her team discovered that the inaccuracies in celestial navigation during the Age of Discovery can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on navigation instruments.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By suggesting that navigators should have relied on alternative methods of navigation, such as dead reckoning or the use of maps' is incorrect because neither text discusses alternative navigation methods.", "'By arguing that the inaccuracies were primarily due to poor craftsmanship of the navigation instruments, such as astrolabes and sextants' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the impact of the Earth's magnetic field, not the quality of instruments.", "'By proposing that the inaccuracies were unavoidable due to the limitations of technology available during the Age of Discovery' is incorrect because Text 2 implies that a better understanding of the Earth's magnetic field could have improved navigation accuracy."], "id": 23063}]
