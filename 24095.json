[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry often explores the connection between love and spirituality. In her iconic Sonnets from the Portuguese, she ______ the notion of divine love, comparing it to the romantic love she shared with her husband, fellow poet Robert Browning.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "will examine", "B": "to examine", "C": "examining", "D": "examines"}, "explanation": "D: 'examines' is the correct answer because it provides a finite present tense verb that agrees with the singular subject 'she' and is consistent with the present tense verbs often used when discussing literary works.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to examine' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive doesn\u2019t supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'examining' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle doesn\u2019t supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'will examine' is incorrect because the future tense verb isn\u2019t consistent with the present tense verbs used when discussing literary works."], "id": 24095}]
