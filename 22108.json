[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Thomas Edison is widely known for inventing the light bulb and for holding over a thousand patents. His inventions have dramatically changed the modern world, and he is often regarded as one of the greatest inventors of all time. Edison's ingenuity was not only in creating new devices but also in improving existing technologies. His approach to inventing was largely based on trial and error, which led to many failed experiments before finding success.", "text_2": "Some historians argue that Edison's reputation as a lone inventor is somewhat overstated. They contend that many of his inventions were the result of collaboration with teams of researchers and engineers. Edison's Menlo Park laboratory, for example, was a hub of scientific innovation where a group of talented individuals worked together to develop groundbreaking technologies. These historians suggest that Edison's true genius lay in his ability to lead and inspire a team."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the historians mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to the portrayal of Edison as a 'lone inventor' discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": " By emphasizing Edison's dedication to trial and error as the primary reason behind his success", "B": " By challenging this portrayal and highlighting the importance of collaboration and teamwork in Edison's innovations", "C": " By arguing that Edison's ingenuity was solely focused on improving existing technologies", "D": " By proposing that Edison's true genius was not in inventing but in his ability to accumulate a large number of patents"}, "explanation": "B: 'By challenging this portrayal and highlighting the importance of collaboration and teamwork in Edison's innovations' is the correct answer because Text 2 presents the historians' view that Edison's reputation as a lone inventor is overstated and that his inventions were often the result of collaboration with teams of researchers and engineers.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing Edison's dedication to trial and error as the primary reason behind his success' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the collaborative nature of Edison's work, not his trial and error approach.", "'By arguing that Edison's ingenuity was solely focused on improving existing technologies' is incorrect because Text 2 discusses the collaborative nature of Edison's work, not just his improvements to existing technologies.", "'By proposing that Edison's true genius was not in inventing but in his ability to accumulate a large number of patents' is incorrect because Text 2 emphasizes Edison's ability to lead and inspire a team, not his ability to accumulate patents."], "id": 22108}]
