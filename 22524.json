[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Daniel Bernoulli was an 18th-century Swiss mathematician and physicist known for his work in fluid dynamics. His most famous contribution, Bernoulli's principle, explains the relationship between fluid speed and pressure, which has significant applications in various fields, such as aviation and engineering.
