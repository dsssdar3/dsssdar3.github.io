A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. Some experts argue that a trade deficit is harmful to a nation's economy, leading to job losses and a decline in domestic industries. Others believe that trade deficits can be beneficial, as they allow countries to access cheaper products and stimulate economic growth.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "A discussion on the consequences of trade deficits on job losses and domestic industries", "B": "A detailed analysis of the factors that contribute to the occurrence of trade deficits", "C": "An argument supporting the idea that trade deficits are beneficial for economic growth", "D": "An overview of the trade deficit concept and the differing opinions on its effects"}, "explanation": "D: 'An overview of the trade deficit concept and the differing opinions on its effects' is the correct answer because the passage introduces the concept of a trade deficit and briefly mentions the contrasting perspectives on its impact on a nation's economy.", "distractor_explanation": ["'A discussion on the consequences of trade deficits on job losses and domestic industries' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions these effects and does not focus solely on the negative consequences.", "'An argument supporting the idea that trade deficits are beneficial for economic growth' is incorrect because the passage presents both sides of the debate and does not advocate for one side.", "'A detailed analysis of the factors that contribute to the occurrence of trade deficits' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the specific causes of trade deficits but rather focuses on the differing opinions about their effects."], "id": 22398}]
