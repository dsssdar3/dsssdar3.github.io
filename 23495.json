Researchers in this field often collaborate with educators to address challenges in teaching and learning, ultimately aiming to enhance the effectiveness of education. Some experts argue that educational engineering could greatly benefit the future of education, while others are more skeptical, believing that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "the integration of technology in education has already reached its peak, rendering further advancements unnecessary.", "B": "the complexity and uniqueness of each learning environment may limit the applicability of engineered solutions.", "C": "educational engineers lack the necessary background in pedagogy to create meaningful improvements in education.", "D": "traditional educational methods have proven effective and should not be disrupted by engineered solutions."}, "explanation": "B: 'the complexity and uniqueness of each learning environment may limit the applicability of engineered solutions.' is the correct answer because it presents a reason for the skepticism towards educational engineering mentioned in the passage.", "distractor_explanation": ["'the integration of technology in education has already reached its peak, rendering further advancements unnecessary.' is incorrect because the passage does not imply that technological advancements have reached their peak in education.", "'educational engineers lack the necessary background in pedagogy to create meaningful improvements in education.' is incorrect because the passage states that researchers in this field collaborate with educators, implying that they work together to address challenges.", "'traditional educational methods have proven effective and should not be disrupted by engineered solutions.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the effectiveness of traditional educational methods or suggest that they should not be disrupted."], "id": 23495}]
