[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Philosopher John Locke, a key figure of the Enlightenment, argued that human beings are born with a blank slate, or 'tabula rasa,' and that their knowledge and beliefs are derived from experience. According to Locke, this concept emphasized the importance of education and the power of individuals to shape their own lives.", "text_2": "Immanuel Kant, another prominent Enlightenment philosopher, believed that human understanding is shaped by both experience and innate faculties of the mind. While he agreed with Locke that experience plays a significant role, he also argued that humans have inherent structures in their minds that help to organize and interpret these experiences."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) most likely respond to the 'tabula rasa' concept discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": " By partially agreeing with Locke's tabula rasa concept, while emphasizing the role of innate mental structures", "B": " By stating that the tabula rasa concept is accurate, but it only applies to a select few individuals", "C": " By claiming that the tabula rasa concept is completely false and should be disregarded entirely", "D": " By arguing that the concept of tabula rasa is irrelevant to the understanding of human knowledge acquisition"}, "explanation": "A: 'By partially agreeing with Locke's tabula rasa concept, while emphasizing the role of innate mental structures' is the correct answer because based on Text 2, Kant agrees with Locke that experience plays a significant role but also believes that humans have inherent structures in their minds that help to organize and interpret these experiences.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By claiming that the tabula rasa concept is completely false and should be disregarded entirely' is incorrect because Kant does not completely disagree with Locke's concept, but rather emphasizes the role of innate mental structures.", "'By stating that the tabula rasa concept is accurate, but it only applies to a select few individuals' is incorrect because neither Text 1 nor Text 2 suggests that the concept would only apply to certain individuals.", "'By arguing that the concept of tabula rasa is irrelevant to the understanding of human knowledge acquisition' is incorrect because Kant does not dismiss the concept as irrelevant, but rather incorporates it into his own understanding of human knowledge."], "id": 21087}]
