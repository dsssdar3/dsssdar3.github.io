[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, initially built as a freestanding bell tower, has been a famous landmark due to its unintended tilt. Engineers have attributed this tilt to inadequate foundation and soft soil beneath the structure. Despite the tower's precarious state, it has remained standing for over 800 years.", "text_2": "Recent research by structural engineer Francesca Martelli and her team suggests that the tower's stability can be attributed to its unique construction. The tower's height and weight distribution help counteract the soft soil's effects, creating a dynamic equilibrium that has allowed the tower to remain standing."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Martelli and her team (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201cinadequate foundation and soft soil\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging the inadequate foundation and soft soil but attributing the tower's longevity to its unique construction and dynamic equilibrium", "B": "By suggesting that the tower's design was intentionally meant to produce a tilt in response to the soft soil beneath it", "C": "By asserting that the tower's tilt is purely an architectural mistake and not a result of foundation or soil issues", "D": "By claiming that the tower's tilt is a myth and there is no evidence of inadequate foundation or soft soil"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the inadequate foundation and soft soil but attributing the tower's longevity to its unique construction and dynamic equilibrium' is the correct answer because in Text 2, Martelli and her team recognize the role of the foundation and soft soil but emphasize the tower's construction as a key factor in its stability.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that the tower's tilt is purely an architectural mistake and not a result of foundation or soil issues' is incorrect because Text 2 emphasizes the role of the tower's construction in its stability, not dismissing the foundation and soil issues.", "'By suggesting that the tower's design was intentionally meant to produce a tilt in response to the soft soil beneath it' is incorrect because neither text discusses the tower's design as intentional.", "'By claiming that the tower's tilt is a myth and there is no evidence of inadequate foundation or soft soil' is incorrect because both texts acknowledge the tower's tilt and the underlying foundation and soil issues."], "id": 23073}]
