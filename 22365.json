Researchers are exploring various BCI applications, from assisting individuals with paralysis to controlling robotic limbs. Despite the remarkable potential of BCIs, ethical concerns arise regarding user privacy and autonomy, as the technology could potentially be exploited by unauthorized parties.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "The text focuses on the negative aspects of brain-computer interfaces, emphasizing potential privacy issues.", "B": "The text argues that brain-computer interfaces are solely beneficial for individuals with paralysis.", "C": "The text introduces brain-computer interfaces, highlighting their potential applications and ethical concerns.", "D": "The text discusses how brain-computer interfaces allow users to control robotic limbs without any ethical concerns."}, "explanation": "C: 'The text introduces brain-computer interfaces, highlighting their potential applications and ethical concerns.' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main idea of the passage, which mentions both the applications and ethical concerns of BCIs.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The text argues that brain-computer interfaces are solely beneficial for individuals with paralysis.' is incorrect because the passage mentions assisting individuals with paralysis as only one of the potential applications.", "'The text focuses on the negative aspects of brain-computer interfaces, emphasizing potential privacy issues.' is incorrect because the passage discusses both potential applications and ethical concerns, rather than solely focusing on the negative aspects.", "'The text discusses how brain-computer interfaces allow users to control robotic limbs without any ethical concerns.' is incorrect because the passage does mention ethical concerns related to BCIs."], "id": 22365}]
