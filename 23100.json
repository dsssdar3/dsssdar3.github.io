Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1936. It responded to the needs for relief, reform, and recovery from the Great Depression. Major federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), and the Social Security Administration (SSA).", "text_2": "Some historians argue that the New Deal was not as successful as it is often portrayed. They claim that while it provided short-term relief, it failed to address the root causes of the Great Depression and that the economy did not fully recover until World War II. Critics also argue that some New Deal policies, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act, hindered economic growth by creating uncertainty for businesses."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the historians mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to the \u201csuccessfulness\u201d of the New Deal discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging the New Deal's effectiveness in providing immediate relief but questioning its long-term impact on economic recovery", "B": "By asserting that the New Deal's policies were largely successful in both providing relief and addressing the root causes of the Great Depression", "C": "By suggesting that the New Deal's accomplishments have been overstated and that the economy only fully recovered due to external factors", "D": "By arguing that the New Deal was not as successful as it is often portrayed, as it failed to address the root causes of the Great Depression"}, "explanation": "D: 'By arguing that the New Deal was not as successful as it is often portrayed, as it failed to address the root causes of the Great Depression' is the correct answer because Text 2 specifically mentions that some historians argue that the New Deal was not as successful as it is often portrayed and that it failed to address the root causes of the Great Depression.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By acknowledging the New Deal's effectiveness in providing immediate relief but questioning its long-term impact on economic recovery' is incorrect because it does not fully capture the historians' argument mentioned in Text 2.", "'By asserting that the New Deal's policies were largely successful in both providing relief and addressing the root causes of the Great Depression' is incorrect because it contradicts the historians' argument mentioned in Text 2.", "'By suggesting that the New Deal's accomplishments have been overstated and that the economy only fully recovered due to external factors' is incorrect because it does not specifically address the historians' argument about the New Deal's failure to address the root causes of the Great Depression mentioned in Text 2."], "id": 23100}]
