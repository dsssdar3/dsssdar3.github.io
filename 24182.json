Thatcher's approach to the economy led to a significant reduction in ______ and a shift in the UK's economic landscape.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "inflation's rate,", "B": "inflation rates'", "C": "inflation rates", "D": "inflations rate"}, "explanation": "C: 'inflation rates' is the correct answer because it appropriately uses the plural form of 'inflation' to describe the rates that were reduced during Thatcher's time in office. The passage discusses multiple rates, and the plural form is required in this context.", "distractor_explanation": ["'inflation's rate,' is incorrect because it uses the singular possessive form of 'inflation' when the passage requires the plural form.", "'inflation rates'' is incorrect because it uses the plural possessive form of 'inflation' when the passage requires the plural form without the possessive.", "'inflations rate' is incorrect because it incorrectly forms the plural of 'inflation' and does not appropriately convey the intended meaning."], "id": 24182}]
