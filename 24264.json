[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In this excerpt from Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, the protagonist grapples with the concept of invisibility as it relates to his identity as an African American man. His invisibility is not a physical trait, but rather a result of society's refusal to acknowledge his existence as an individual with thoughts, feelings, and dreams. Through the exploration of this theme, Ellison sheds light on the broader issue of racial discrimination and marginalization that permeates society during the time period.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The protagonist's journey to find a way to become physically invisible", "B": "The protagonist's struggle with invisibility as a metaphor for racial discrimination and marginalization", "C": "Ralph Ellison's personal experiences with invisibility and racial discrimination", "D": "A detailed analysis of various forms of invisibility in literature and their implications"}, "explanation": "B: 'The protagonist's struggle with invisibility as a metaphor for racial discrimination and marginalization' is the correct answer because the passage highlights the protagonist's experience of being invisible due to society's refusal to acknowledge his individuality, which ties into the broader theme of racial discrimination.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The protagonist's journey to find a way to become physically invisible' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the protagonist's invisibility as a metaphor for racial discrimination, not on a quest for physical invisibility.", "'Ralph Ellison's personal experiences with invisibility and racial discrimination' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the protagonist's experiences, not Ellison's personal life.", "'A detailed analysis of various forms of invisibility in literature and their implications' is incorrect because the passage specifically discusses the theme of invisibility in Invisible Man, not invisibility in literature more broadly."], "id": 24264}]
