[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In control systems engineering, feedback loops play a critical role in maintaining the stability of a system. Negative feedback loops help regulate a system by detecting deviations from the desired state and making corrective actions to minimize the error. Positive feedback loops, on the other hand, can amplify deviations and lead to unstable behavior. While both types of feedback loops serve a purpose, it is essential to carefully design and implement them to ensure optimal system performance.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To emphasize the importance of feedback loops in control systems engineering and their impact on system stability", "B": "To provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of control systems used in various industries", "C": "To argue that negative feedback loops are always more beneficial than positive feedback loops in any control system", "D": "To examine the historical development of control systems engineering and its impact on modern technology"}, "explanation": "A: 'To emphasize the importance of feedback loops in control systems engineering and their impact on system stability' is the correct answer because the passage specifically discusses the roles of negative and positive feedback loops in maintaining system stability.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of control systems used in various industries' is incorrect because the passage only focuses on feedback loops in control systems engineering, not an overview of different types of control systems.", "'To argue that negative feedback loops are always more beneficial than positive feedback loops in any control system' is incorrect because the passage does not make a direct comparison between negative and positive feedback loops, but rather explains their roles in system stability.", "'To examine the historical development of control systems engineering and its impact on modern technology' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the historical development or the impact of control systems engineering on technology."], "id": 24018}]
