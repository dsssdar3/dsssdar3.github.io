[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Automotive electronics engineer Dr. Alice Roberts has developed an innovative technique to improve the efficiency of electric vehicle batteries by using a combination of materials science and electrical engineering principles. Her research suggests that this new method can increase battery life and reduce charging times by optimizing the distribution of power within the battery cells.", "text_2": "In contrast, engineer Dr. John Smith has focused on creating a novel cooling system for electric vehicle batteries, designed to prevent overheating and maximize performance. Dr. Smith's research emphasizes the importance of thermal management in maintaining battery health and extending the life of electric vehicles."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. John Smith (Text 2) most likely respond to Dr. Alice Roberts' technique (Text 1)?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By expressing concern that her technique may negatively impact the thermal management of the battery", "B": "By asserting that her research is outdated and that newer methods have already rendered her technique obsolete", "C": "By acknowledging the potential benefits of her technique, while maintaining that thermal management is also crucial to battery health", "D": "By arguing that her focus on materials science and electrical engineering principles is misguided and ineffective"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging the potential benefits of her technique, while maintaining that thermal management is also crucial to battery health' is the correct answer because Text 2 indicates that Dr. Smith's research emphasizes the importance of thermal management in maintaining battery health, but does not directly dispute Dr. Roberts' research.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By expressing concern that her technique may negatively impact the thermal management of the battery' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest any negative impact of Dr. Roberts' technique on thermal management.", "'By asserting that her research is outdated and that newer methods have already rendered her technique obsolete' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention any newer methods or criticize Dr. Roberts' technique as outdated.", "'By arguing that her focus on materials science and electrical engineering principles is misguided and ineffective' is incorrect because Text 2 does not criticize Dr. Roberts' approach or principles."], "id": 23081}]
