By incorporating eco-friendly materials, green spaces, and efficient public transportation systems, urban engineers aim to create urban environments that minimize negative impacts on the environment while fostering a high quality of life for residents. This interdisciplinary approach to city planning addresses challenges related to population growth, resource management, and climate change.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To introduce urban engineering as a field focused on sustainable city planning and design", "B": "To emphasize the importance of eco-friendly materials in urban engineering projects", "C": "To discuss the role of public transportation systems in mitigating climate change", "D": "To highlight the interdisciplinary nature of urban engineering as a unique aspect of the field"}, "explanation": "A: 'To introduce urban engineering as a field focused on sustainable city planning and design' is the correct answer because the passage primarily discusses the overall goals and focus of urban engineering, which include designing sustainable cities that minimize environmental impacts and promote a high quality of life for residents.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To emphasize the importance of eco-friendly materials in urban engineering projects' is incorrect because, although the passage mentions eco-friendly materials, it does not focus solely on their importance.", "'To discuss the role of public transportation systems in mitigating climate change' is incorrect because the passage briefly mentions efficient public transportation systems but does not delve into their specific role in addressing climate change.", "'To highlight the interdisciplinary nature of urban engineering as a unique aspect of the field' is incorrect because the passage does mention the interdisciplinary approach of urban engineering, but it is not the main focus or purpose of the text."], "id": 23019}]
