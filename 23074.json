[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Economists have observed that low-interest rates often lead to increased spending since borrowing money becomes more affordable. As a result, economic growth is expected due to higher consumer spending and business investments.", "text_2": "In contrast, some financial experts argue that low-interest rates can lead to asset bubbles and overinvestment in risky assets, as investors search for higher yields.
