[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "During the Gilded Age, the United States experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth, leading to an increase in wealth and prosperity. However, this wealth was concentrated among a small group of individuals, resulting in a vast income inequality. Workers often faced harsh working conditions and low wages, leading to the rise of labor unions and increased efforts for workers' rights. In contrast, the upper class enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle, indulging in opulent mansions and extravagant social events.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To highlight the stark contrast between the wealthy elite and the working class during the Gilded Age", "B": "To focus solely on the positive aspects of the Gilded Age, such as industrialization and economic growth", "C": "To argue that the Gilded Age was a time of unmitigated suffering and hardship for the majority of Americans", "D": "To discuss the role of labor unions in shaping the political landscape of the Gilded Age"}, "explanation": "A: 'To highlight the stark contrast between the wealthy elite and the working class during the Gilded Age' is the correct answer because the passage demonstrates the growing wealth disparity and the different experiences of the upper class and the working class.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To focus solely on the positive aspects of the Gilded Age, such as industrialization and economic growth' is incorrect because the passage also discusses the negative aspects, like income inequality and harsh working conditions.", "'To argue that the Gilded Age was a time of unmitigated suffering and hardship for the majority of Americans' is incorrect because the passage also mentions the prosperity and economic growth experienced during this period.", "'To discuss the role of labor unions in shaping the political landscape of the Gilded Age' is incorrect because labor unions are only mentioned briefly as a response to workers' conditions and not as a central focus of the passage."], "id": 24029}]
