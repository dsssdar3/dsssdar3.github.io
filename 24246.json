[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In mechanical engineering, the study of gear trains is essential for understanding power transmission. Gear trains comprise multiple gears, and the combination of these gears determines the speed, torque, and direction of the transmitted power. Consequently, engineers need to carefully consider gear ratios and material properties when designing gear trains for specific applications.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "The various applications of gear trains in the field of mechanical engineering", "B": "The importance of studying gear trains in mechanical engineering for effective power transmission", "C": "The historical development of gear trains and their role in mechanical engineering", "D": "The different types of gears used in gear trains and their individual functions"}, "explanation": "B: 'The importance of studying gear trains in mechanical engineering for effective power transmission' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on how gear trains are essential for understanding power transmission and their role in mechanical engineering.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The various applications of gear trains in the field of mechanical engineering' is incorrect because the passage does not provide specific examples of applications.", "'The historical development of gear trains and their role in mechanical engineering' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the history of gear trains.", "'The different types of gears used in gear trains and their individual functions' is incorrect because the passage does not elaborate on specific gears and their functions."], "id": 24246}]
