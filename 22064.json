[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Alan Turing, widely known as the father of computer science, created a machine in the 1940s that was capable of breaking encrypted messages during World War II. His invention, known as the Turing machine, was instrumental in deciphering Nazi communication, ultimately aiding the Allies in their victory.", "text_2": "In addition to his work on the Turing machine, Alan Turing also proposed the Turing Test in 1950, a method to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. The test involves a human evaluator who engages in a natural language conversation with a machine and a human, without knowing which is which."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the \u201cTuring machine\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging its significance during World War II, while emphasizing Turing's contributions to artificial intelligence", "B": "By disputing the importance of the Turing machine and arguing that the Turing Test had a greater impact on computer science", "C": "By suggesting that the Turing machine was a precursor to the Turing Test and that they are essentially the same concept", "D": "By claiming that the Turing machine was a minor accomplishment compared to Turing's work in other fields such as mathematics"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging its significance during World War II, while emphasizing Turing's contributions to artificial intelligence' is the correct answer because Text 2 focuses on Turing's contributions to artificial intelligence through the Turing Test, while also acknowledging the significance of the Turing machine in the context of World War II as mentioned in Text 1.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By disputing the importance of the Turing machine and arguing that the Turing Test had a greater impact on computer science' is incorrect because Text 2 does not dispute the importance of the Turing machine, but rather highlights another aspect of Turing's work.", "'By suggesting that the Turing machine was a precursor to the Turing Test and that they are essentially the same concept' is incorrect because the texts do not imply that the Turing machine and Turing Test are the same concept or that one led directly to the other.", "'By claiming that the Turing machine was a minor accomplishment compared to Turing's work in other fields such as mathematics' is incorrect because Text 2 does not downplay the significance of the Turing machine or compare it to Turing's work in other fields."], "id": 22064}]
