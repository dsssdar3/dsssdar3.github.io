It is believed that during this time, the souls of the departed return to visit their families. Families create elaborate altars, or ofrendas, to welcome and honor the spirits. They are adorned with candles, marigolds, and the favorite foods of the deceased. _______ the holiday also includes lively parades, music, and dancing to celebrate the lives of those who have passed.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "However", "B": "Instead", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Moreover"}, "explanation": "D: 'Moreover' is the correct answer because it logically signals that the additional information about parades, music, and dancing is another way in which the Day of the Dead is celebrated, adding to the previous information about the ofrendas.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Instead' is incorrect because it illogically suggests that parades, music, and dancing replace the ofrendas, which is not the case.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it illogically implies a contrast between the ofrendas and the parades, music, and dancing, when they are all part of the celebration.", "'However' is incorrect because it illogically indicates a contrast or exception to the information about the ofrendas, which is not the case."], "id": 23554}]
