[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on designing, integrating, and managing complex systems over their life cycles. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the interactions between various components within a system, as well as the system's relationship with its environment. Systems engineering principles can be applied to a wide range of industries, from aerospace and defense to healthcare and telecommunications. By employing a holistic perspective, systems engineers can ensure that all aspects of a project are considered, resulting in more efficient and effective solutions.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To compare systems engineering with other engineering disciplines and highlight their unique features and challenges", "B": "To argue that systems engineering is the most effective approach for solving complex problems in various industries", "C": "To discuss the historical development of systems engineering and its influence on modern engineering practices", "D": "To provide an overview of systems engineering as a multidisciplinary field that emphasizes the design, integration, and management of complex systems"}, "explanation": "D: 'To provide an overview of systems engineering as a multidisciplinary field that emphasizes the design, integration, and management of complex systems' is the correct answer because the passage describes the central aspects of systems engineering and mentions its applications across various industries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that systems engineering is the most effective approach for solving complex problems in various industries' is incorrect because the passage does not make a direct comparison or argument about the effectiveness of systems engineering.", "'To discuss the historical development of systems engineering and its influence on modern engineering practices' is incorrect because the passage does not mention the history or development of systems engineering.", "'To compare systems engineering with other engineering disciplines and highlight their unique features and challenges' is incorrect because the passage does not compare systems engineering to other disciplines or discuss specific features and challenges unique to systems engineering."], "id": 21022}]
