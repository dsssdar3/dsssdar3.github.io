[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Plastics engineering involves the creation and development of various types of plastics for a wide range of applications. These applications range from packaging materials to automotive components, medical devices, and even construction materials. One crucial aspect of plastics engineering is the selection of appropriate materials for each specific application. _______ the effective design of the final product is essential in ensuring that it meets the necessary performance, aesthetic, and environmental requirements.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand,", "B": "Nevertheless,", "C": "Similarly,", "D": "In contrast,"}, "explanation": "C: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it highlights that both the selection of appropriate materials and the effective design of the final product are important aspects of plastics engineering.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nevertheless' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between the selection of appropriate materials and the effective design of the final product, which is not the case.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies that the effective design of the final product is an alternative or contrasting aspect to the selection of appropriate materials, which is not the case.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a contrast between the selection of appropriate materials and the effective design of the final product, which is not the case."], "id": 24370}]
