[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "During the Great Depression, many countries implemented protectionist measures to stimulate domestic economies. The United States, for example, enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, which significantly raised import tariffs on thousands of goods. Critics argue that these protectionist policies exacerbated the global economic crisis, as countries retaliated with their own trade barriers, leading to a decline in international trade and further worsening the economic situation worldwide.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To provide a detailed analysis of the economic policies adopted by various countries during the Great Depression", "B": "To argue that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the primary cause of the Great Depression", "C": "To describe the implementation of protectionist measures during the Great Depression and their potential negative consequences", "D": "To explore the long-term effects of the Great Depression on international trade and relations"}, "explanation": "C: 'To describe the implementation of protectionist measures during the Great Depression and their potential negative consequences' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the introduction of protectionist policies like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and how they may have worsened the global economic crisis.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the primary cause of the Great Depression' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the causes of the Great Depression, but rather the potential negative consequences of the protectionist policies.", "'To provide a detailed analysis of the economic policies adopted by various countries during the Great Depression' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the implementation of protectionist measures and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of different countries' policies.", "'To explore the long-term effects of the Great Depression on international trade and relations' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the immediate consequences of protectionist policies during the Great Depression, not their long-term effects."], "id": 23006}]
