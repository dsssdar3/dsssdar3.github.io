[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Literary critic Alice Young explores the role of nature in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, arguing that the beauty of Middle-earth's landscapes serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving the natural world. She posits that Tolkien's vivid descriptions of forests, rivers, and mountains emphasize the value of harmony between nature and civilization.", "text_2": "Environmental historian John Green disagrees with Young's interpretation, stating that while Tolkien's portrayal of Middle-earth is undeniably beautiful, the focus of the story is on the struggle between good and evil, not environmental preservation.
