[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In vehicle engineering, the chassis is the skeletal framework that supports the vehicle's components. It is responsible for providing stability and structure, allowing the vehicle to withstand the forces it encounters. Various materials, such as steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber, are used in chassis design, each with its advantages and drawbacks. Engineers must optimize chassis designs for factors like strength, weight, and cost to create an efficient, safe, and high-performing vehicle.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "An overview of the importance of chassis design in vehicle engineering.", "B": "The role chassis play in providing a stable structure in vehicle engineering.", "C": "A detailed analysis of different materials used in chassis design.", "D": "A discussion on how engineers optimize chassis designs for various factors."}, "explanation": "A: 'An overview of the importance of chassis design in vehicle engineering' is the correct answer because the passage provides a brief introduction to the concept of chassis design, its role in vehicle stability, materials used, and the factors engineers consider while optimizing the design.", "distractor_explanation": ["'A detailed analysis of different materials used in chassis design' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the materials, without going into detail.", "'The role chassis play in providing a stable structure in vehicle engineering' is incorrect because it only focuses on one aspect of the passage, not the main idea.", "'A discussion on how engineers optimize chassis designs for various factors' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the factors without going into an in-depth discussion."], "id": 23387}]
