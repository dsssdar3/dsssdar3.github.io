[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Educational engineering is a multidisciplinary field that involves the design, development, and evaluation of learning environments and instructional methods. By combining expertise in engineering, cognitive science, and education, professionals in this field work to optimize learning experiences for students. They create innovative solutions to address challenges in education, such as fostering engagement, promoting critical thinking, and enhancing knowledge retention. Through the use of cutting-edge technologies, educational engineers aim to transform traditional classrooms into dynamic, learner-centered environments.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the challenges that educational engineers face when implementing new technologies", "B": "To analyze the role of cognitive science in the development of learning environments", "C": "To advocate for the importance of incorporating engineering principles in education", "D": "To describe the field of educational engineering and its goals"}, "explanation": "D: 'To describe the field of educational engineering and its goals' is the correct answer because the passage provides an overview of the role of educational engineering in designing learning environments and instructional methods, as well as its aim to optimize learning experiences for students.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To analyze the role of cognitive science in the development of learning environments' is incorrect because, while cognitive science is mentioned, the focus of the text is on the broader field of educational engineering.", "'To advocate for the importance of incorporating engineering principles in education' is incorrect because the text describes the field of educational engineering but does not specifically argue for its importance.", "'To discuss the challenges that educational engineers face when implementing new technologies' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the field's goals and methods, rather than the challenges faced in implementing new technologies."], "id": 23003}]
