[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "The game of bowling consists of ten frames in which a player attempts to knock down pins by rolling a ball. A perfect game, with a score of 300, occurs when a player achieves a strike in each frame and ______ the bonus points awarded for consecutive strikes.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "accumulating", "B": "has accumulated", "C": "accumulates", "D": "will accumulate"}, "explanation": "C: 'accumulates' is the correct answer because it is consistent with the present tense verbs used earlier in the passage (e.g., 'consists', 'attempts', and 'occurs') and maintains proper tense throughout the passage.", "distractor_explanation": ["'accumulating' is incorrect because it is a nonfinite verb form and doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'has accumulated' is incorrect because it uses the present perfect tense, which doesn't fit the context of the passage.", "'will accumulate' is incorrect because it uses the future tense, which doesn't fit the context of the passage."], "id": 22121}]
