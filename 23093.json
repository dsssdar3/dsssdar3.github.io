[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "During the Great Depression, many economists believed that the key to economic recovery was increasing consumer spending. They argued that by increasing demand for goods and services, businesses would be encouraged to expand production and hire more workers, eventually leading to a rebound in the overall economy.", "text_2": "However, some economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, proposed a different approach. Keynes believed that government intervention through increased public spending on infrastructure projects and other programs was necessary to stimulate economic growth and combat the devastating effects of the Great Depression."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Keynes (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201ckey to economic recovery\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By arguing that the Great Depression was an inevitable consequence of economic cycles and no intervention could have prevented it", "B": "By agreeing that consumer spending is the primary driver of economic recovery and should be the main focus of government efforts", "C": "By suggesting that government intervention and increased public spending are more effective means of stimulating economic growth", "D": "By emphasizing the importance of international trade and cooperation in addressing the economic challenges of the Great Depression"}, "explanation": "C: 'By suggesting that government intervention and increased public spending are more effective means of stimulating economic growth' is the correct answer because in Text 2, Keynes proposes a different approach to economic recovery, which involves government intervention through increased public spending.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By agreeing that consumer spending is the primary driver of economic recovery and should be the main focus of government efforts' is incorrect because Keynes proposed a different approach involving government intervention, not just relying on consumer spending.", "'By arguing that the Great Depression was an inevitable consequence of economic cycles and no intervention could have prevented it' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention Keynes' view on the inevitability of the Great Depression, but rather focuses on his proposed solution.", "'By emphasizing the importance of international trade and cooperation in addressing the economic challenges of the Great Depression' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on Keynes' belief in government intervention through increased public spending, not on international trade and cooperation."], "id": 23093}]
