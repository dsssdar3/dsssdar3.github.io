The arms race between the two superpowers led to the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which could deliver nuclear warheads thousands of miles away. _______ the United States and the Soviet Union both invested heavily in developing anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems as a means of defense.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Alternatively", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Similarly"}, "explanation": "B: 'Consequently' is the correct answer because it logically connects the development of ICBMs with the subsequent investment in ABM systems as a response.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests there was a choice between developing ICBMs and ABM systems, rather than one being a response to the other.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it suggests that the development of ABM systems is in opposition to or different from the development of ICBMs, rather than a response.", "'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies that the development of ABM systems is similar to the development of ICBMs, but the passage is discussing their development as a response to the threat posed by ICBMs."], "id": 22545}]
