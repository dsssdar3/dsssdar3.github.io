These self-navigating vessels rely on sensors, artificial intelligence, and advanced communication systems to operate without human intervention. While the benefits, such as reduced labor costs and increased safety, are driving the development of autonomous ships, concerns surrounding cybersecurity and the potential loss of jobs in the maritime sector remain.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To provide an overview of autonomous ships and discuss the benefits and concerns associated with their development.", "B": "To argue that autonomous ships should be prioritized due to their potential to revolutionize the maritime industry.", "C": "To offer a detailed analysis of the technology used in autonomous ships and its impact on the shipping industry.", "D": "To emphasize the importance of addressing cybersecurity concerns before fully integrating autonomous ships into the maritime sector."}, "explanation": "A: 'To provide an overview of autonomous ships and discuss the benefits and concerns associated with their development.' is the correct answer because the passage introduces the topic of autonomous ships, briefly mentions the technology behind them, and outlines both the advantages and potential issues related to their development.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that autonomous ships should be prioritized due to their potential to revolutionize the maritime industry.' is incorrect because the passage does not take a stance on whether autonomous ships should be prioritized.", "'To offer a detailed analysis of the technology used in autonomous ships and its impact on the shipping industry.' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the technology involved and does not provide an in-depth analysis.", "'To emphasize the importance of addressing cybersecurity concerns before fully integrating autonomous ships into the maritime sector.' is incorrect because the passage mentions cybersecurity concerns as one of the potential issues, but does not focus solely on them or their importance."], "id": 21040}]
