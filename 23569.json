To preserve these ecosystems, many countries have established marine protected areas (MPAs) around their reefs. _______ in some cases, these MPAs have been criticized for not having sufficient resources or enforcement to protect the coral reefs effectively.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "As a result", "B": "Similarly", "C": "However", "D": "Furthermore"}, "explanation": "C: 'However' is the correct answer because it shows a contrast between the establishment of MPAs and the criticism regarding their effectiveness in protecting coral reefs.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it does not show a contrast between the positive action of establishing MPAs and the criticism of their effectiveness.", "'As a result' is incorrect because it implies that the criticism is a consequence of establishing MPAs, but the passage intends to contrast the two ideas.", "'Furthermore' is incorrect because it suggests an additional point in support of MPAs, rather than contrasting the establishment of MPAs with the criticism of their effectiveness."], "id": 23569}]
