[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Queen Isabella I of Spain is well-known for her support of Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492. Her decision to finance his expedition to Asia by sailing westward ultimately led to the discovery of the Americas. Many historians believe that Queen Isabella's support for Columbus was motivated by her desire to spread Christianity and increase Spain's wealth through trade.", "text_2": "Queen Isabella I's reign is also notable for her efforts to centralize the Spanish government and establish a more efficient system of governance. The consolidation of power under her rule is often considered as one of the driving factors behind Spain's emergence as a major world power during the 16th century. Some historians argue that her primary motivation for these reforms was to strengthen Spain's position in Europe and secure her own legacy."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the historians from Text 2 most likely respond to the motivation for supporting Columbus discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": " By acknowledging the desire to spread Christianity and increase wealth, but emphasizing the broader context of strengthening Spain's position", "B": " By suggesting that the motivation to spread Christianity was a cover for her true ambition of expanding Spain's territories", "C": " By expressing doubt about her motivations for supporting Columbus, as the primary focus was on centralizing power", "D": " By claiming that her support for Columbus was purely a personal endeavor, unrelated to her efforts in governance or national interests"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the desire to spread Christianity and increase wealth, but emphasizing the broader context of strengthening Spain's position' is the correct answer because Text 2 mentions that Queen Isabella I's primary motivation for her governance reforms was to strengthen Spain's position in Europe and secure her own legacy. Therefore, the historians from Text 2 would likely agree with the motivation discussed in Text 1, but emphasize the broader context.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By expressing doubt about her motivations for supporting Columbus, as the primary focus was on centralizing power' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest that the historians doubt the motivations mentioned in Text 1.", "'By suggesting that the motivation to spread Christianity was a cover for her true ambition of expanding Spain's territories' is incorrect because neither text implies that spreading Christianity was a cover for territorial expansion.", "'By claiming that her support for Columbus was purely a personal endeavor, unrelated to her efforts in governance or national interests' is incorrect because both texts discuss her support for Columbus in the context of her broader goals for Spain."], "id": 22101}]
