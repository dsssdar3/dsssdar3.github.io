[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Edward Albee's play 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is a landmark in American theatre, depicting the emotional turmoil experienced by a married couple. Utilizing dark humor, Albee exposes the bitter reality of human relationships and the facades people create to protect themselves from the truth.", "text_2": "Critics often note that Albee's writing is heavily influenced by the Theatre of the Absurd, a dramatic movement that challenges the conventional structure of plays. This movement aims to portray the human condition as fundamentally absurd, revealing the disintegration of communication and the futility of finding meaning in life."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the Theatre of the Absurd (Text 2) most likely respond to the \u201cemotional turmoil\u201d and \u201cbitter reality\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are irrelevant to the larger themes of existentialism and metaphysics often explored in the Theatre of the Absurd", "B": "By arguing that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are direct consequences of traditional playwriting techniques, which Theatre of the Absurd seeks to challenge", "C": "By considering the emotional turmoil and bitter reality as an unavoidable aspect of human existence that should be celebrated rather than criticized", "D": "By emphasizing that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are manifestations of the absurdity inherent in human relationships and the disintegration of communication"}, "explanation": "D: 'By emphasizing that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are manifestations of the absurdity inherent in human relationships and the disintegration of communication' is the correct answer because it connects the Theatre of the Absurd's focus on the absurdity of human relationships with the emotional turmoil and bitter reality depicted in Albee's play.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are direct consequences of traditional playwriting techniques, which Theatre of the Absurd seeks to challenge' is incorrect because it does not acknowledge the emotional turmoil as a manifestation of the absurdity inherent in human relationships.", "'By considering the emotional turmoil and bitter reality as an unavoidable aspect of human existence that should be celebrated rather than criticized' is incorrect because it does not connect with the Theatre of the Absurd's focus on the disintegration of communication and the futility of finding meaning in life.", "'By suggesting that the emotional turmoil and bitter reality are irrelevant to the larger themes of existentialism and metaphysics often explored in the Theatre of the Absurd' is incorrect because it does not recognize the connection between the emotional turmoil and the absurdity inherent in human relationships."], "id": 23110}]
