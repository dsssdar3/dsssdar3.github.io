Among his many inventions, the development of alternating current (AC) power transmission revolutionized the way electricity was harnessed and distributed. Tesla's AC system overcame the limitations of direct current (DC) power, enabling the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances and shaping the modern electrical power grid.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Nikola Tesla's relentless pursuit of knowledge led him to create groundbreaking inventions.", "B": "Nikola Tesla's invention of alternating current power transmission transformed the way electricity was harnessed and distributed.", "C": "Nikola Tesla's rivalry with Thomas Edison motivated him to develop the alternating current system.", "D": "Nikola Tesla's many contributions to electrical engineering and physics are often overlooked in favor of other inventors."}, "explanation": "B: 'Nikola Tesla's invention of alternating current power transmission transformed the way electricity was harnessed and distributed.' is the correct answer because the passage highlights Tesla's development of AC power transmission and its impact on the electrical power grid.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nikola Tesla's relentless pursuit of knowledge led him to create groundbreaking inventions.' is incorrect because although the passage acknowledges Tesla's contributions, it does not focus on his pursuit of knowledge.", "'Nikola Tesla's rivalry with Thomas Edison motivated him to develop the alternating current system.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any rivalry with Edison.", "'Nikola Tesla's many contributions to electrical engineering and physics are often overlooked in favor of other inventors.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Tesla's contributions being overlooked."], "id": 23399}]
