[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Ecological engineering involves designing ecosystems to provide benefits for humans and the environment. Through the integration of engineering principles and ecological processes, experts can create sustainable solutions for various challenges, such as water quality improvement, habitat restoration, and climate change mitigation. By embracing nature-based strategies, ecological engineering fosters the development of resilient and adaptable systems.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "Ecological engineering primarily focuses on water quality improvement and habitat restoration.", "B": "Ecological engineering combines engineering and ecology to create sustainable solutions for environmental challenges.", "C": "Ecological engineering is a controversial field due to its reliance on nature-based strategies.", "D": "Ecological engineering is limited in its ability to address climate change mitigation."}, "explanation": "B: 'Ecological engineering combines engineering and ecology to create sustainable solutions for environmental challenges.' is the correct answer because the passage highlights the integration of engineering principles and ecological processes to address various challenges.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Ecological engineering primarily focuses on water quality improvement and habitat restoration.' is incorrect because the passage mentions these as examples of challenges, not as the primary focus.", "'Ecological engineering is a controversial field due to its reliance on nature-based strategies.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any controversy surrounding the field.", "'Ecological engineering is limited in its ability to address climate change mitigation.' is incorrect because the passage states that it can create solutions for challenges like climate change mitigation."], "id": 21390}]
