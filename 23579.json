[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "In J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, the magical sport of Quidditch is played by witches and wizards on broomsticks. Each team has three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The Chasers are responsible for scoring goals with the Quaffle, earning their team ten points for each successful shot. _______ the Seeker's main objective is to catch the Golden Snitch, which ends the game and awards their team an additional 150 points.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "However", "B": "Therefore", "C": "Meanwhile", "D": "Additionally"}, "explanation": "C: 'Meanwhile' is the correct answer because it shows that the information about the Seeker's role is happening concurrently with the Chasers' actions, highlighting the different responsibilities of the players within the same game.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Therefore' is incorrect because it signals a cause-and-effect relationship, which is not present between the roles of Chasers and Seekers.", "'However' is incorrect because it signals a contrast or exception, and the roles of Chasers and Seekers do not contrast one another in this context.", "'Additionally' is incorrect because it implies that the Seeker's role is an extra piece of information about the Chasers, rather than a separate aspect of the game."], "id": 23579}]
