[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Ecological engineering, a multidisciplinary field, focuses on designing and managing ecosystems to provide environmental benefits. By combining ecological principles and engineering practices, this approach aims to create sustainable systems that enhance biodiversity and improve water quality. One example is the use of constructed wetlands to treat wastewater, mimicking natural wetlands' ability to filter pollutants. Ecological engineering can also address climate change challenges, such as sea-level rise, by implementing natural coastal protection strategies like mangrove restoration.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To introduce ecological engineering as a field that merges ecological principles and engineering practices for environmental benefits", "B": "To argue that ecological engineering is the only solution to address climate change and improve water quality", "C": "To emphasize the importance of constructed wetlands in the treatment of wastewater and their superiority over natural wetlands", "D": "To provide an in-depth analysis of various ecological engineering projects and their impact on biodiversity"}, "explanation": "A: 'To introduce ecological engineering as a field that merges ecological principles and engineering practices for environmental benefits' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main purpose of the text, which is to introduce the field of ecological engineering and highlight its goals and applications.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that ecological engineering is the only solution to address climate change and improve water quality' is incorrect because the text does not claim that ecological engineering is the only solution, but rather presents it as an approach to address these issues.", "'To emphasize the importance of constructed wetlands in the treatment of wastewater and their superiority over natural wetlands' is incorrect because the text only provides this as an example of an application of ecological engineering, not as the main focus.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of various ecological engineering projects and their impact on biodiversity' is incorrect because the text merely introduces the field and provides a few examples, rather than analyzing specific projects."], "id": 24036}]
