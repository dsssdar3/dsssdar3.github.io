[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Agricultural technology has revolutionized the way food is produced, increasing crop yields and reducing environmental impacts. Precision farming, for instance, uses advanced tools such as GPS systems and sensors to optimize the use of resources like water and fertilizer. This approach improves efficiency by providing real-time data, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their operations. As a result, modern agriculture can produce more food with fewer resources, ultimately benefiting both the environment and the global food supply.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To argue for the necessity of government intervention in regulating the use of advanced technologies in agriculture", "B": "To discuss the historical development of agricultural practices from traditional farming methods to modern technology-driven techniques", "C": "To highlight the advancements in agricultural technology and their positive impact on resource efficiency and food production", "D": "To compare the environmental benefits of precision farming with those of other sustainable agriculture techniques"}, "explanation": "C: 'To highlight the advancements in agricultural technology and their positive impact on resource efficiency and food production' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the benefits of precision farming, a modern agricultural technology, in optimizing resource use and increasing food production.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the historical development of agricultural practices from traditional farming methods to modern technology-driven techniques' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the history of agricultural practices, but rather focuses on the benefits of modern technology.", "'To argue for the necessity of government intervention in regulating the use of advanced technologies in agriculture' is incorrect because the passage does not mention government intervention or regulation.", "'To compare the environmental benefits of precision farming with those of other sustainable agriculture techniques' is incorrect because the passage does not provide any comparison to alternative techniques, but focuses on the benefits of precision farming."], "id": 21009}]
