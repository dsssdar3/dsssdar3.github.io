[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Inferences", "passage": "Swarm robotics involves the coordination of multiple robots to work together, mimicking the collective behavior of insects or animals. This approach can improve efficiency and flexibility in various applications, such as search and rescue missions or environmental monitoring. However, one challenge in swarm robotics is the development of effective communication strategies among the robots, which is crucial for achieving______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "a better understanding of the natural behavior of insects or animals.", "B": "optimal performance and coordination in completing tasks.", "C": "reduced energy consumption and increased battery life for individual robots.", "D": "an increase in the overall number of robots within the swarm."}, "explanation": "B: 'optimal performance and coordination in completing tasks.' is the correct answer because the passage discusses the importance of communication strategies for swarm robotics, which directly impacts the performance and coordination of the robots.", "distractor_explanation": ["'a better understanding of the natural behavior of insects or animals.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the development of communication strategies for swarm robotics, not on studying the natural behavior of insects or animals.", "'reduced energy consumption and increased battery life for individual robots.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss energy consumption or battery life.", "'an increase in the overall number of robots within the swarm.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the communication strategies among robots and not on the number of robots in the swarm."], "id": 23526}]
