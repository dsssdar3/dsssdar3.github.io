[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "In hydrological engineering, the Manning's equation is a well-known empirical formula used to estimate the velocity of water flow in an open channel. The formula is often written as V = (1/n) * R^(2/3) * S^(1/2), where V represents the velocity, n is the Manning's roughness coefficient, R is the hydraulic radius, and S is the channel slope. The equation assumes that the flow is ______ and the channel is uniform.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "steady", "B": "to be steady", "C": "steadying", "D": "being steady"}, "explanation": "A: 'steady' is the correct answer because it provides a proper adjective to describe the flow in the context of the Manning's equation.", "distractor_explanation": ["'to be steady' is incorrect because it doesn't provide an appropriate adjective to describe the flow.", "'steadying' is incorrect because it is a present participle that doesn't fit the context of the sentence.", "'being steady' is incorrect because it doesn't provide a suitable adjective to describe the flow."], "id": 22170}]
