Industrial control systems are used in industrial production for controlling equipment or machines. There are two main types of industrial control systems: the traditional open-loop system, which ______ a specific action in response to a specific input, and the closed-loop system, which adjusts its output based on feedback.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "performed", "B": "performing", "C": "to perform", "D": "performs"}, "explanation": "D: 'performs' is the correct answer because it provides the clause with the finite present tense verb needed to properly indicate the action taken by the open-loop system in response to a specific input.", "distractor_explanation": ["'performing' is incorrect because the nonfinite participle doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'to perform' is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'performed' is incorrect because the past tense verb is not consistent with the other present tense verbs used to describe the industrial control systems."], "id": 21121}]
