When individuals or organizations allocate resources to one area, they often have to sacrifice resources in another. For example, a company might decide to invest in research and development, which could lead to the reduction of its marketing budget. This decision reflects the trade-off between the short-term benefits of promoting existing products and the long-term advantages of creating innovative solutions.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Explaining the benefits of a company investing solely in research and development", "B": "Arguing that marketing budgets should always be prioritized over research and development", "C": "Describing the concept of trade-offs in the context of resource allocation", "D": "Illustrating the consequences of not making trade-offs in economic decisions"}, "explanation": "C: 'Describing the concept of trade-offs in the context of resource allocation' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the idea of trade-offs and provides an example of how they can play out in a company's decision-making process.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Explaining the benefits of a company investing solely in research and development' is incorrect because the passage does not advocate for this specific strategy, but rather explains the concept of trade-offs.", "'Arguing that marketing budgets should always be prioritized over research and development' is incorrect because the passage does not make this argument, but simply uses the example to illustrate trade-offs.", "'Illustrating the consequences of not making trade-offs in economic decisions' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the consequences of not making trade-offs, only the concept and an example of a trade-off."], "id": 22367}]
