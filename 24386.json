[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Gas engineering involves the safe extraction, transportation, and utilization of natural gas. One of the most common techniques is hydraulic fracturing, which involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to release the gas trapped in rock formations. _______ natural gas is considered a cleaner energy source than coal and oil, as it produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "In contrast", "B": "Similarly", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Although"}, "explanation": "D: 'Although' is the correct answer because it signals a contrast between the common technique of hydraulic fracturing and the fact that natural gas is considered a cleaner energy source.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Similarly' is incorrect because it implies a similarity between the two parts of the sentence, which is not the case as there is a contrast between the technique and the cleaner nature of natural gas.", "'Therefore' is incorrect because it suggests a conclusion or consequence based on the previous statement, which is not the intended relationship between the two parts of the sentence.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a strong contrast between two different subjects, but the passage is discussing the same subject \u2013 natural gas."], "id": 24386}]
