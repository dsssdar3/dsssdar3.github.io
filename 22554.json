[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "The Aztecs were known for their agricultural innovations, such as the chinampa system of raised fields, which allowed them to grow crops in the shallow lakes of their region. These floating gardens provided them with a rich and diverse food supply. _______ they also practiced a variety of rituals and ceremonies, including human sacrifice, to appease the gods and ensure a good harvest.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "On the other hand,", "B": "Nonetheless,", "C": "In addition,", "D": "Alternatively,"}, "explanation": "C: 'In addition' is the correct answer because it logically connects the information about the Aztecs' agricultural innovations with the additional detail about their religious rituals and ceremonies related to agriculture.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nonetheless' is incorrect because it indicates a contrast or exception, which is not the relationship between agricultural innovations and religious practices in this context.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or alternative, whereas the passage is adding information about religious practices to the discussion of agricultural innovations.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests an alternative option or possibility, but the passage is providing additional information about the Aztecs' religious practices related to agriculture, not an alternative to their agricultural innovations."], "id": 22554}]
