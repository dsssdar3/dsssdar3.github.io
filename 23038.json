[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Lab-grown meat, also known as cultured meat, is produced by culturing animal cells in a controlled environment. This innovative method eliminates the need to raise and slaughter animals, significantly reducing the environmental impact of meat production. Proponents argue that lab-grown meat has the potential to address issues such as climate change, animal welfare, and food security, while critics express concerns about the cost, taste, and public acceptance of this novel food source.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To advocate for the adoption of lab-grown meat by consumers and the food industry", "B": "To argue that lab-grown meat is the only viable solution to address climate change", "C": "To discuss the technological challenges in producing lab-grown meat at a large scale", "D": "To introduce lab-grown meat and highlight its potential benefits and concerns"}, "explanation": "D: 'To introduce lab-grown meat and highlight its potential benefits and concerns' is the correct answer because the passage provides an overview of lab-grown meat, its production process, and its potential advantages and disadvantages.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that lab-grown meat is the only viable solution to address climate change' is incorrect because the passage does not claim that lab-grown meat is the only solution to the problem; it only mentions its potential benefits.", "'To discuss the technological challenges in producing lab-grown meat at a large scale' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the technical aspects of lab-grown meat production.", "'To advocate for the adoption of lab-grown meat by consumers and the food industry' is incorrect because the passage presents both potential benefits and concerns, rather than solely promoting the adoption of lab-grown meat."], "id": 23038}]
