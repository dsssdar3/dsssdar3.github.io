[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer, discovered the relationship between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars, which helped in measuring the distance between Earth and other galaxies. Her groundbreaking work laid the foundation for extragalactic astronomy and the understanding of the expansion of the universe.", "text_2": "Many scientists have since built upon Leavitt's work with Cepheid variable stars. For example, Edwin Hubble utilized her findings to calculate the distance to the Andromeda galaxy, which ultimately led to the discovery of the universe's expansion. Leavitt's work remains a cornerstone in the field of astronomy, with her discoveries continuing to inform modern research."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the scientists mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to Leavitt's discovery discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By considering her work as a minor contribution to the field of astronomy and focusing on more recent advancements", "B": "By questioning the validity of her discoveries and devising alternative methods to measure the distance to other galaxies", "C": "By acknowledging its significance and utilizing her findings to further explore the universe and its expansion", "D": "By arguing that her discoveries are no longer relevant in today's context and suggesting the need for new methods to replace her work"}, "explanation": "C: 'By acknowledging its significance and utilizing her findings to further explore the universe and its expansion' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses how scientists like Edwin Hubble built upon Leavitt's work and used her findings to make significant discoveries, such as the expansion of the universe.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By questioning the validity of her discoveries and devising alternative methods to measure the distance to other galaxies' is incorrect because Text 2 highlights how scientists built upon her work, rather than questioning it.", "'By considering her work as a minor contribution to the field of astronomy and focusing on more recent advancements' is incorrect because Text 2 emphasizes the significance of Leavitt's work in the field of astronomy.", "'By arguing that her discoveries are no longer relevant in today's context and suggesting the need for new methods to replace her work' is incorrect because Text 2 states that Leavitt's work remains a cornerstone in the field of astronomy and continues to inform modern research."], "id": 21083}]
