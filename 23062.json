[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Ceramic engineering is a branch of materials science that focuses on the development and processing of ceramic materials. These materials are generally characterized by their hardness, resistance to wear, and high melting points. The use of ceramics in various applications, such as electronics and aerospace, has led to a growing interest in researching and developing new ceramic materials and processing techniques.", "text_2": "In a recent study, ceramic engineers have discovered a novel method for producing ceramic materials with increased toughness and ductility. By introducing specific nanoparticles into the ceramic matrix, the researchers were able to alter the material's microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties. This breakthrough could potentially revolutionize the way ceramics are used in various industries, as the new materials could withstand higher stresses and strains without fracturing."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the traditional characteristics of ceramic materials discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By emphasizing the importance of maintaining the inherent properties of ceramics, such as hardness and resistance to wear", "B": "By questioning the need for high melting points in ceramic materials, as it may limit their applications in certain industries", "C": "By suggesting that their novel method can enhance the traditional characteristics of ceramic materials, making them even more suitable for various applications", "D": "By arguing that the focus should be on developing alternative materials rather than improving the properties of existing ceramic materials"}, "explanation": "C: 'By suggesting that their novel method can enhance the traditional characteristics of ceramic materials, making them even more suitable for various applications' is the correct answer because Text 2 discusses the researchers' breakthrough in producing ceramic materials with improved toughness and ductility, which can potentially revolutionize the way ceramics are used in various industries.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing the importance of maintaining the inherent properties of ceramics, such as hardness and resistance to wear' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on enhancing the properties of ceramic materials, not just maintaining them.", "'By questioning the need for high melting points in ceramic materials, as it may limit their applications in certain industries' is incorrect because neither text discusses any drawbacks to high melting points in ceramic materials.", "'By arguing that the focus should be on developing alternative materials rather than improving the properties of existing ceramic materials' is incorrect because Text 2 specifically discusses a novel method for improving the properties of ceramic materials."], "id": 23062}]
