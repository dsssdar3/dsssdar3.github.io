[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Word In Context", "passage": "In plastics engineering, thermosetting polymers are widely used due to their ability to maintain their shape and strength when heated. However, once they have been set, they cannot be re-melted or re-formed, making them ______ during the recycling process.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "expansive", "B": "versatile", "C": "transparent", "D": "inflexible"}, "explanation": "D: 'inflexible' is the correct answer because it accurately describes the inability of thermosetting polymers to be re-melted or re-formed during the recycling process.", "distractor_explanation": ["'versatile' is incorrect because it suggests a wide range of uses or adaptability, which is not the case for thermosetting polymers during recycling.", "'transparent' is incorrect because it refers to the physical appearance or clarity of a material, which is irrelevant to the recycling process.", "'expansive' is incorrect because it suggests a large size or scope, which is not related to the properties of thermosetting polymers during recycling."], "id": 23350}]
