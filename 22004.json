[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Engineering focuses on the development and implementation of advanced technologies to enhance the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of transportation networks. ITS Engineering encompasses various disciplines, including traffic management, vehicle communication systems, and data analysis, to achieve the overarching goal of improving transportation systems through innovative methods. By leveraging modern technology and data-driven decision-making, ITS Engineering seeks to reduce congestion, minimize accidents, and promote sustainable transportation practices.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To highlight specific examples of successful ITS Engineering implementations around the world", "B": "To discuss the historical evolution of transportation systems and their impact on society", "C": "To provide an overview of Intelligent Transportation Systems Engineering and its objectives", "D": "To emphasize the importance of vehicle communication systems in addressing traffic problems"}, "explanation": "C: 'To provide an overview of Intelligent Transportation Systems Engineering and its objectives' is the correct answer because the passage briefly describes the focus of ITS Engineering, its various disciplines, and its goals for improving transportation systems.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the historical evolution of transportation systems and their impact on society' is incorrect because the passage focuses on ITS Engineering rather than the history of transportation systems.", "'To highlight specific examples of successful ITS Engineering implementations around the world' is incorrect because the passage provides a general overview of ITS Engineering without mentioning specific examples.", "'To emphasize the importance of vehicle communication systems in addressing traffic problems' is incorrect because although vehicle communication systems are mentioned as a part of ITS Engineering, the passage's main purpose is to provide a broader overview of the field."], "id": 22004}]
