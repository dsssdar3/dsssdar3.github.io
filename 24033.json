However, critics of the policy argue that such measures ultimately harm the economy by limiting consumer choice and discouraging international trade.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the consequences of limiting consumer choices in the global market", "B": "To argue that domestic industries should be given priority over international trade", "C": "To outline a government's implementation of protective tariffs and the rationale behind them", "D": "To assert that international trade is more beneficial than protecting domestic industries"}, "explanation": "C: 'To outline a government's implementation of protective tariffs and the rationale behind them' is the correct answer because the passage introduces the concept of protective tariffs, explains their purpose, and briefly mentions opposing views.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that domestic industries should be given priority over international trade' is incorrect because the passage does not take a position on the issue, but rather presents the rationale behind the policy.", "'To discuss the consequences of limiting consumer choices in the global market' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the consequences of the policy and focuses more on the rationale behind it.", "'To assert that international trade is more beneficial than protecting domestic industries' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for or against either side but presents the rationale for the implementation of protective tariffs."], "id": 24033}]
