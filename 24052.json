Their innovative approach to solving the problem of flight involved a combination of engineering, scientific understanding, and practical experimentation.

They point out that other inventors of the time, such as Samuel Langley, were working on similar concepts but ultimately failed due to lack of funding or support. The Wright Brothers, however, persevered despite numerous setbacks and eventually succeeded in achieving controlled, powered flight."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would historians in Text 2 most likely respond to the \u201cinnovative approach\u201d discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging the innovations but asserting that persistence and determination played a more significant role in their success", "B": "By suggesting that the combination of engineering, scientific understanding, and practical experimentation was unique to the Wright Brothers", "C": "By emphasizing the importance of the three-axis control system as the key to the Wright Brothers' success", "D": "By arguing that the Wright Brothers' approach was not as innovative as it is often portrayed, given the work of other inventors at the time"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging the innovations but asserting that persistence and determination played a more significant role in their success' is the correct answer because Text 2 focuses on the importance of the Wright Brothers' persistence and determination, rather than their technical innovations.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By emphasizing the importance of the three-axis control system as the key to the Wright Brothers' success' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the role of persistence and determination, not the technical innovations.", "'By suggesting that the combination of engineering, scientific understanding, and practical experimentation was unique to the Wright Brothers' is incorrect because Text 2 does not argue that their approach was unique.", "'By arguing that the Wright Brothers' approach was not as innovative as it is often portrayed, given the work of other inventors at the time' is incorrect because Text 2 does not explicitly downplay the innovative aspects of their approach."], "id": 24052}]
