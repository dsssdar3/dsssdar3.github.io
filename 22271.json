[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Boundaries", "passage": "Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, is best known for his work on electrical resistance. His groundbreaking research led to the establishment of Ohm's Law, which states that the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the ______ and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "two point", "B": "two points\u2019", "C": "2 points\u2019", "D": "two points"}, "explanation": "D: 'two points' is the correct answer because it correctly uses the plural noun 'two points' to refer to the two points between which the current passes.", "distractor_explanation": ["'two point' is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun 'points' instead of the singular 'point'.", "'two points\u2019' is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun 'two points' and not the plural possessive noun 'two points\u2019'.", "'2 points\u2019' is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun 'two points' and not the numerical and plural possessive form '2 points\u2019'."], "id": 22271}]
