[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In gas engineering, the process of removing impurities from natural gas is called purification. Various techniques, such as adsorption and absorption, are employed to achieve this objective. These methods help separate undesirable components, like water vapor and sulfur compounds, from the natural gas, making it suitable for transportation and consumption.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "A brief overview of the purification process in gas engineering", "B": "An explanation of the transportation process of natural gas", "C": "A detailed comparison of adsorption and absorption techniques in gas engineering", "D": "The economic importance of removing impurities from natural gas"}, "explanation": "A: 'A brief overview of the purification process in gas engineering' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the objective of purification in gas engineering and mentions various techniques used for this purpose.", "distractor_explanation": ["'A detailed comparison of adsorption and absorption techniques in gas engineering' is incorrect because the passage does not compare the techniques in detail.", "'An explanation of the transportation process of natural gas' is incorrect because the passage does not explain the transportation process.", "'The economic importance of removing impurities from natural gas' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the economic implications of purification."], "id": 23380}]
