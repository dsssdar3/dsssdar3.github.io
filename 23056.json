Economic issues, such as inflation and a shrinking tax base, weakened the empire from within. Additionally, the empire's vast size made it difficult to govern effectively, leading to political instability. Moreover, the constant threat of invasions from barbarian tribes, including the Visigoths and Vandals, further contributed to Rome's eventual collapse.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To outline various factors that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire", "B": "To emphasize the role of barbarian invasions in the decline of Rome", "C": "To discuss the economic prosperity of the Roman Empire before its fall", "D": "To argue that the Roman Empire's size was the primary reason for its decline"}, "explanation": "A: 'To outline various factors that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire' is the correct answer because the passage discusses economic issues, political instability, and barbarian invasions as contributing factors.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To emphasize the role of barbarian invasions in the decline of Rome' is incorrect because, while mentioned, it is only one of the factors discussed in the passage.", "'To discuss the economic prosperity of the Roman Empire before its fall' is incorrect because the passage focuses on the decline, not the prosperity.", "'To argue that the Roman Empire's size was the primary reason for its decline' is incorrect because the passage presents multiple factors, not just the empire's size."], "id": 23056}]
