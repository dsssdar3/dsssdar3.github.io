[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Power engineer Elizabeth Johnson and her team have been researching the efficiency of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems for long-distance power transmission. They found that HVDC systems can transmit power with less energy loss than traditional alternating current (AC) systems, making them a more sustainable choice for power transmission over vast distances.", "text_2": "In contrast, power engineer Robert Garcia and his colleagues have examined the challenges and potential drawbacks of HVDC systems. They argue that although HVDC systems can be more efficient for long-distance transmission, the high cost and complexity of converting AC to DC and back can offset the benefits of decreased energy loss."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Garcia and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the efficiency claims made by Johnson and her team (Text 1)?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "By asserting that HVDC systems are not only more efficient but also more cost-effective in the long run", "B": "By acknowledging the efficiency of HVDC systems but questioning the overall cost-effectiveness and practicality", "C": "By emphasizing the environmental benefits of HVDC systems in terms of reducing carbon emissions", "D": "By suggesting that the efficiency claims made by Johnson and her team are based on outdated research"}, "explanation": "B: 'By acknowledging the efficiency of HVDC systems but questioning the overall cost-effectiveness and practicality' is the correct answer because Text 2 acknowledges the increased efficiency of HVDC systems for long-distance transmission but raises concerns about the high cost and complexity of converting AC to DC and back.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By asserting that HVDC systems are not only more efficient but also more cost-effective in the long run' is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the potential drawbacks and challenges of HVDC systems, not their cost-effectiveness.", "'By emphasizing the environmental benefits of HVDC systems in terms of reducing carbon emissions' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention environmental benefits or carbon emissions.", "'By suggesting that the efficiency claims made by Johnson and her team are based on outdated research' is incorrect because Text 2 does not question the validity of Johnson's research, but rather discusses the challenges and potential drawbacks of HVDC systems."], "id": 24079}]
