[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Ski jumping has long been a sport where athletes strive to achieve the farthest possible jump. Traditionally, ski jumpers have focused on their takeoff techniques to maximize distance. However, recent research has shown that the aerodynamics of the jumper's body during flight plays an equally important role in determining the success of a jump.", "text_2": "In a new study, biomechanics expert Dr. Sarah Thompson and her team investigated the impact of different body positions on ski jumpers' flight distance. The study concluded that maintaining a consistent, streamlined body position throughout the jump is crucial for maximizing distance. Additionally, the team found that minute adjustments to the arms and legs could have a significant impact on a jumper's aerodynamics and, subsequently, their overall performance."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dr. Sarah Thompson and her team (Text 2) most likely respond to the traditional focus on takeoff techniques discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "By arguing that takeoff techniques are the sole determinant of successful ski jumping and should remain the primary focus", "B": "By suggesting that ski jumpers should only focus on their takeoff techniques and ignore their body position during flight", "C": "By emphasizing the importance of considering aerodynamics and body position during flight as equally crucial factors", "D": "By recommending that ski jumpers should abandon traditional takeoff techniques in favor of solely focusing on aerodynamics"}, "explanation": "C: 'By emphasizing the importance of considering aerodynamics and body position during flight as equally crucial factors' is the correct answer because Text 2 highlights the significance of maintaining a streamlined body position during flight to maximize distance, implying that both takeoff techniques and aerodynamics are important.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By suggesting that ski jumpers should only focus on their takeoff techniques and ignore their body position during flight' is incorrect because Text 2 emphasizes the importance of body position during flight.", "'By arguing that takeoff techniques are the sole determinant of successful ski jumping and should remain the primary focus' is incorrect because Text 2 highlights the importance of aerodynamics and body position during flight.", "'By recommending that ski jumpers should abandon traditional takeoff techniques in favor of solely focusing on aerodynamics' is incorrect because Text 2 does not suggest completely disregarding takeoff techniques."], "id": 23060}]
