[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, is known for his groundbreaking research on the inheritance of traits in pea plants. Mendel's experiments led to the development of the fundamental principles of genetics. By crossbreeding pea plants with different traits, Mendel discovered that offspring inherit traits from their parents in predictable patterns. His findings, known as Mendel's Laws, laid the foundation for the modern understanding of heredity and the field of genetics.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To explore the personal life and daily routines of Gregor Mendel, the Austrian monk who made groundbreaking discoveries in genetics", "B": "To provide a detailed account of the specific experiments that Gregor Mendel conducted on pea plants and the exact methods he used", "C": "To explain the significance of Gregor Mendel's research on the inheritance of traits in pea plants and its impact on the field of genetics", "D": "To argue that Gregor Mendel's research on pea plants was flawed and that his findings should not be considered the foundation of genetics"}, "explanation": "C: 'To explain the significance of Gregor Mendel's research on the inheritance of traits in pea plants and its impact on the field of genetics' is the correct answer because the passage focuses on the importance of Mendel's experiments, the discovery of predictable patterns of inheritance, and the establishment of Mendel's Laws.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To provide a detailed account of the specific experiments that Gregor Mendel conducted on pea plants and the exact methods he used' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions Mendel's crossbreeding experiments but does not provide specific details or methods.", "'To explore the personal life and daily routines of Gregor Mendel, the Austrian monk who made groundbreaking discoveries in genetics' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss Mendel's personal life or daily routines.", "'To argue that Gregor Mendel's research on pea plants was flawed and that his findings should not be considered the foundation of genetics' is incorrect because the passage highlights the significance and impact of Mendel's research on the field of genetics, not any flaws in his work."], "id": 23032}]
