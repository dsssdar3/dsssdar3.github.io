The dissolution was primarily attributed to economic struggles, political instability, and the desire for independence among various Soviet states.

The collapse of the Soviet Union ultimately led to the emergence of 15 independent states and a significant shift in global power dynamics.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To provide a brief overview of the factors that contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its consequences", "B": "To argue that the fall of the Soviet Union was the direct result of a single political decision made by its leaders", "C": "To explore the economic and social reforms that were implemented in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to its collapse", "D": "To analyze the reasons behind the Soviet Union's attempts to maintain control over its territories despite the growing desire for independence"}, "explanation": "A: 'To provide a brief overview of the factors that contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its consequences' is the correct answer because the passage summarizes the main reasons for the fall of the Soviet Union and its aftermath.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that the fall of the Soviet Union was the direct result of a single political decision made by its leaders' is incorrect because the passage states that the collapse was due to multiple factors, not just one decision.", "'To explore the economic and social reforms that were implemented in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to its collapse' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into specific reforms but rather focuses on the reasons for the dissolution.", "'To analyze the reasons behind the Soviet Union's attempts to maintain control over its territories despite the growing desire for independence' is incorrect because the passage does not analyze these reasons but instead provides a general overview of the factors leading to the collapse."], "id": 21045}]
