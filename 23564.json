[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Control systems engineering plays a vital role in various industries, from aerospace to robotics. It focuses on designing and maintaining systems that ensure efficiency, reliability, and stability of processes. For example, control systems engineers create algorithms for autopilot systems in airplanes. _______ they also develop sophisticated methods for controlling robotic arms in manufacturing plants.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "However,", "B": "On the other hand,", "C": "In contrast,", "D": "Similarly,"}, "explanation": "D: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it logically connects the two examples given in the passage, showing that control systems engineers work on a variety of applications, such as autopilot systems in airplanes and robotic arms in manufacturing plants.", "distractor_explanation": ["'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast between the two examples, which is not the intended meaning.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it indicates a difference between the two examples, when both examples are intended to illustrate the diverse applications of control systems engineering.", "'However' is incorrect because it implies a contradiction between the two examples, when both are meant to highlight the various areas in which control systems engineering is applied."], "id": 23564}]
