[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Isaac Barrow was a 17th-century English mathematician who is best known for his work on infinitesimal calculus. He made significant contributions to the field and mentored Sir Isaac Newton, who later expanded on Barrow's ideas.", "text_2": "In addition to his mathematical achievements, Barrow was also a skilled theologian and served as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. He published several works on theology, which demonstrated his deep understanding of religious texts and his ability to connect them with scientific concepts."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the focus on Barrow's work in infinitesimal calculus discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "By acknowledging Barrow's contributions to infinitesimal calculus while emphasizing his additional accomplishments in theology", "B": "By suggesting that Barrow's achievements in mathematics were overemphasized due to his association with Sir Isaac Newton", "C": "By arguing that Barrow's work in infinitesimal calculus was not as important as his contributions to theology", "D": "By questioning the validity of Barrow's work in infinitesimal calculus and proposing alternative theories for his success"}, "explanation": "A: 'By acknowledging Barrow's contributions to infinitesimal calculus while emphasizing his additional accomplishments in theology' is the correct answer because Text 2 highlights Barrow's skills as a theologian and his role as a professor, indicating the author would recognize his mathematical achievements while also stressing his theological work.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By arguing that Barrow's work in infinitesimal calculus was not as important as his contributions to theology' is incorrect because Text 2 does not undermine his mathematical contributions.", "'By suggesting that Barrow's achievements in mathematics were overemphasized due to his association with Sir Isaac Newton' is incorrect because Text 2 does not mention Newton or imply an overemphasis on Barrow's mathematical work.", "'By questioning the validity of Barrow's work in infinitesimal calculus and proposing alternative theories for his success' is incorrect because Text 2 does not challenge the credibility of Barrow's mathematical contributions."], "id": 21081}]
