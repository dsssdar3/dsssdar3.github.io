[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Safety engineering is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design and implementation of systems, procedures, and technologies to reduce the risk of accidents and hazards. The field encompasses a wide range of industries, including aviation, transportation, and manufacturing. A key aspect of safety engineering is the use of risk assessment techniques to identify potential hazards and determine the most effective ways to mitigate or eliminate them. This ensures that products, processes, and environments are designed with the utmost consideration for human safety.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "To introduce the field of safety engineering and its goal of reducing accidents and hazards through risk assessment", "B": "To discuss the specific risk assessment techniques used in aviation and transportation industries", "C": "To argue that safety engineering should be a mandatory requirement for all manufacturing industries", "D": "To provide an in-depth analysis of the various factors that contribute to the success of safety engineering in different industries"}, "explanation": "A: 'To introduce the field of safety engineering and its goal of reducing accidents and hazards through risk assessment' is the correct answer because the passage provides a general overview of safety engineering, its purpose, and the use of risk assessment techniques.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the specific risk assessment techniques used in aviation and transportation industries' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions these industries but does not go into detail about the techniques used.", "'To argue that safety engineering should be a mandatory requirement for all manufacturing industries' is incorrect because the passage does not make an argument for mandatory requirements.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of the various factors that contribute to the success of safety engineering in different industries' is incorrect because the passage only provides a brief introduction to the field and does not delve into an in-depth analysis."], "id": 21032}]
