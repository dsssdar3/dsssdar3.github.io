[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Thomas Edison is often celebrated for his many inventions, such as the incandescent light bulb and the phonograph. However, his lesser-known achievements in the field of electrochemistry also deserve recognition. Edison's work in this field led to the development of rechargeable batteries, which he believed would revolutionize the automobile industry. He spent years perfecting his nickel-iron battery, hoping to replace the internal combustion engine with a cleaner, more efficient electric alternative.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that Thomas Edison's inventions in electrochemistry were more significant than his work on the light bulb and phonograph", "B": "To highlight Thomas Edison's lesser-known contributions to electrochemistry and their potential impact on the automobile industry", "C": "To provide an in-depth analysis of Thomas Edison's experiments with rechargeable batteries and their development process", "D": "To discuss the rivalry between Thomas Edison and other inventors in the field of electrochemistry and their race to create a viable electric car"}, "explanation": "B: 'To highlight Thomas Edison's lesser-known contributions to electrochemistry and their potential impact on the automobile industry' is the correct answer because the passage emphasizes Edison's work in electrochemistry, specifically rechargeable batteries, and his belief in their potential to revolutionize the automobile industry.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that Thomas Edison's inventions in electrochemistry were more significant than his work on the light bulb and phonograph' is incorrect because the passage does not compare the significance of his various inventions, but rather highlights his lesser-known achievements.", "'To provide an in-depth analysis of Thomas Edison's experiments with rechargeable batteries and their development process' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions his work on the nickel-iron battery and does not delve into the specifics of its development process.", "'To discuss the rivalry between Thomas Edison and other inventors in the field of electrochemistry and their race to create a viable electric car' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any rivalry or competition between inventors."], "id": 21020}]
