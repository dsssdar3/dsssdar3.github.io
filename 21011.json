[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "In 1946, William Faulkner submitted a short story, 'A Fable,' to The Atlantic Monthly. The story was rejected, but Faulkner expanded it into a novel, published in 1954. 'A Fable' went on to win the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award. The book is set during World War I and explores themes of leadership, morality, and the human condition through the story of a soldier who is executed for refusing an order to attack.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "To discuss how World War I influenced the themes and characters in William Faulkner's works", "B": "To argue that William Faulkner should have received more recognition for his short stories", "C": "To analyze the literary techniques employed by Faulkner in his novel 'A Fable'", "D": "To outline the journey of Faulkner's 'A Fable' from rejection to critical acclaim"}, "explanation": "D: 'To outline the journey of Faulkner's 'A Fable' from rejection to critical acclaim' is the correct answer because the passage describes how 'A Fable' was initially rejected as a short story, later expanded into a novel, and eventually won prestigious awards.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that William Faulkner should have received more recognition for his short stories' is incorrect because the passage does not argue for more recognition for Faulkner's short stories, but rather focuses on the success of 'A Fable' as a novel.", "'To analyze the literary techniques employed by Faulkner in his novel 'A Fable'' is incorrect because the passage does not delve into the specific techniques used by Faulkner in the novel, but rather talks about its journey from rejection to acclaim.", "'To discuss how World War I influenced the themes and characters in William Faulkner's works' is incorrect because the passage only briefly mentions the setting of 'A Fable' and does not discuss the broader influence of World War I on Faulkner's works."], "id": 21011}]
