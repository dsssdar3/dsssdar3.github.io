In its aftermath, the Bill of Rights was enacted, which set limitations on the power of the monarchy and laid the foundation for modern parliamentary democracy.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To argue that the Glorious Revolution was a necessary response to the tyranny of King James II", "B": "To provide a brief overview of the Glorious Revolution and its impact on the development of parliamentary democracy", "C": "To analyze the role of Mary II and William III in the successful establishment of a constitutional monarchy", "D": "To discuss the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights and their implications for individual liberties"}, "explanation": "B: 'To provide a brief overview of the Glorious Revolution and its impact on the development of parliamentary democracy' is the correct answer because the passage describes the events and outcomes of the Glorious Revolution, including the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the enactment of the Bill of Rights.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that the Glorious Revolution was a necessary response to the tyranny of King James II' is incorrect because the passage does not make an argument about the necessity of the revolution, but rather provides a brief overview of its consequences.", "'To analyze the role of Mary II and William III in the successful establishment of a constitutional monarchy' is incorrect because the passage does not focus on analyzing their roles, but provides a broader overview of the revolution's outcomes.", "'To discuss the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights and their implications for individual liberties' is incorrect because the passage mentions the Bill of Rights as one of the outcomes of the Glorious Revolution, but does not delve into its specific provisions or implications."], "id": 23020}]
