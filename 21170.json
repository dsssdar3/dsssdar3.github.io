[{"domain": "Standard English Convention", "skill": "Form, Structure, and Sense", "passage": "Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, was inspired by the Salem witch trials of the 1690s. The play, which premiered in 1953, not only told a dramatic story but also ______ a veiled criticism of the anti-communist hysteria during the McCarthy era.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "had offered", "B": "to offer", "C": "will offer", "D": "offered"}, "explanation": "D: 'offered' is the correct answer because it provides the appropriate simple past tense verb to express that Arthur Miller's play contained a veiled criticism of the McCarthy era at the time it premiered.", "distractor_explanation": ["'had offered' is incorrect because the past perfect tense is not necessary in this context.", "'to offer' is incorrect because the infinitive form does not supply the main clause with a finite verb.", "'will offer' is incorrect because the future tense is not appropriate for describing an event that occurred in the past."], "id": 21170}]
