[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are innovative technologies that enable communication between the brain and external devices, such as computers or prosthetic limbs. BCIs have shown tremendous promise in assisting individuals with severe disabilities or paralysis, allowing them to regain some degree of control over their environment. While these cutting-edge systems have demonstrated remarkable potential, they also raise ethical concerns, such as privacy and security issues related to brain data.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To discuss the various uses and applications of brain-computer interfaces in different fields", "B": "To emphasize the importance of brain-computer interfaces in overcoming physical disabilities", "C": "To present brain-computer interfaces as promising tools for assisting disabled individuals while acknowledging ethical concerns", "D": "To argue that the ethical concerns surrounding brain-computer interfaces outweigh their potential benefits"}, "explanation": "C: 'To present brain-computer interfaces as promising tools for assisting disabled individuals while acknowledging ethical concerns' is the correct answer because the passage highlights both the potential benefits of BCIs for disabled individuals and the ethical concerns that come along with this technology.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To discuss the various uses and applications of brain-computer interfaces in different fields' is incorrect because the passage focuses on BCIs' use for assisting disabled individuals and the ethical concerns, rather than discussing a variety of applications.", "'To emphasize the importance of brain-computer interfaces in overcoming physical disabilities' is incorrect because the passage also addresses ethical concerns, not just the benefits of BCIs.", "'To argue that the ethical concerns surrounding brain-computer interfaces outweigh their potential benefits' is incorrect because the passage presents both benefits and concerns without asserting that one outweighs the other."], "id": 21372}]
