[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "In electrical engineering, capacitors play a vital role in the design of analog circuits. Capacitors store electrical energy in the form of an electric field, allowing them to block DC current while permitting AC current to pass. This property of capacitors enables engineers to design filters, oscillators, and voltage regulators, among other critical components in a wide range of applications.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Capacitors, by storing electrical energy and selectively permitting current flow, play a crucial role in analog circuit design.", "B": "The ability of capacitors to block AC current and allow DC current to pass is crucial in electrical engineering.", "C": "Capacitors are essential components in digital circuits due to their ability to store electrical energy.", "D": "The primary function of capacitors in electrical engineering is to design voltage regulators and maintain stable voltages."}, "explanation": "A: 'Capacitors, by storing electrical energy and selectively permitting current flow, play a crucial role in analog circuit design.' is the correct answer because it accurately summarizes the main idea that capacitors are vital in analog circuit design due to their ability to store electrical energy and their property of allowing certain types of current to pass.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Capacitors are essential components in digital circuits due to their ability to store electrical energy.' is incorrect because the passage focuses on analog circuits, not digital circuits.", "'The ability of capacitors to block AC current and allow DC current to pass is crucial in electrical engineering.' is incorrect because the passage states that capacitors block DC current and permit AC current to pass, which is the opposite of what this choice claims.", "'The primary function of capacitors in electrical engineering is to design voltage regulators and maintain stable voltages.' is incorrect because, although voltage regulators are mentioned as one of the applications, the passage emphasizes the broader role of capacitors in analog circuit design."], "id": 21402}]
