One of his key achievements is the introduction of the Cauchy sequence, a concept that ______ the foundation for the rigorous formulation of the limit in calculus.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "lays on", "B": "laid", "C": "will lay", "D": "laying"}, "explanation": "B: 'laid' is the correct answer because it provides the appropriate past tense verb to indicate that Cauchy's introduction of the sequence occurred in the past, while also maintaining the correct grammatical structure of the sentence.", "distractor_explanation": ["'lays on' is incorrect because it does not properly convey the past tense and does not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.", "'will lay' is incorrect because it suggests a future action, which is not appropriate for describing a historical achievement.", "'laying' is incorrect because it does not provide the necessary finite verb form for the sentence and is not consistent with the past tense context."], "id": 22147}]
