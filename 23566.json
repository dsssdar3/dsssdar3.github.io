[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician, made significant contributions to various branches of mathematics, including number theory and mathematical analysis. Despite his lack of formal education in mathematics, Ramanujan was able to derive complex mathematical equations and formulas. _______ he caught the attention of British mathematician G. H. Hardy, who invited him to study and collaborate at the University of Cambridge.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "Likewise", "B": "Alternatively", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Consequently"}, "explanation": "D: 'Consequently' is the correct answer because it indicates a logical result of Ramanujan's ability to derive complex mathematical equations and formulas, which led to him catching the attention of G. H. Hardy.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Alternatively' is incorrect because it suggests that there is an alternative option or possibility, which is not the case in this context.", "'In contrast' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or difference, while the passage discusses a logical outcome of Ramanujan's mathematical abilities.", "'Likewise' is incorrect because it indicates similarity with a previous statement, but the passage is discussing the outcome of Ramanujan's abilities."], "id": 23566}]
