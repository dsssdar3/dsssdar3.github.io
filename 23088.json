[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev is best known for his creation of the Periodic Table of Elements. He placed elements in order of increasing atomic weight, leaving gaps for elements that were not yet discovered. This innovative arrangement allowed scientists to predict the properties of undiscovered elements.", "text_2": "Mendeleev's Periodic Table has undergone several modifications since its inception. For instance, Henry Moseley reorganized the table by atomic number, rather than atomic weight.
