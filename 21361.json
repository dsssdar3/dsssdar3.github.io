[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Surveying engineering is a specialized field that deals with the accurate measurement and mapping of the Earth's surface. Surveyors use advanced technology, such as GPS and remote sensing, to collect data on land, water, and air boundaries. This data is crucial for various industries, including construction, transportation, and environmental management. By providing precise information on the location and dimensions of natural and man-made features, surveying engineers play a vital role in the planning and implementation of infrastructure projects.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Surveying engineers often face challenges in their work due to the complex nature of the Earth's surface.", "B": "The history of surveying engineering goes back centuries, with advancements in technology making it more sophisticated.", "C": "Surveying engineering focuses on the precise measurement and mapping of the Earth's surface for various industries.", "D": "The role of surveying engineers in society is often overlooked, but their contributions are essential."}, "explanation": "C: 'Surveying engineering focuses on the precise measurement and mapping of the Earth's surface for various industries.' is the correct answer because the passage describes how surveying engineering deals with the accurate measurement and mapping of the Earth's surface and its importance for industries like construction, transportation, and environmental management.", "distractor_explanation": ["'The history of surveying engineering goes back centuries, with advancements in technology making it more sophisticated.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the history of surveying engineering.", "'Surveying engineers often face challenges in their work due to the complex nature of the Earth's surface.' is incorrect because the passage does not mention any challenges faced by surveying engineers.", "'The role of surveying engineers in society is often overlooked, but their contributions are essential.' is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the recognition or lack thereof for surveying engineers in society."], "id": 21361}]
