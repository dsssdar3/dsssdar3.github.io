While many skaters can perform double axels with relative ease, the triple axel requires an additional half rotation in the air.

Despite the challenges, skaters who successfully complete a triple axel are rewarded with higher scores, which can greatly impact their overall performance in competitions.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "To provide a detailed history of the triple axel and its introduction to the sport", "B": "To argue that the triple axel should not be included in figure skating competitions", "C": "To explain the significance and difficulty of the triple axel in figure skating", "D": "To describe the various techniques used by skaters to successfully perform a triple axel"}, "explanation": "C: 'To explain the significance and difficulty of the triple axel in figure skating' is the correct answer because the text emphasizes the challenging nature of the jump, its potential impact on a skater's score, and how it differentiates from the double axel.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To argue that the triple axel should not be included in figure skating competitions' is incorrect because the text does not make any argument against the inclusion of the triple axel in competitions.", "'To provide a detailed history of the triple axel and its introduction to the sport' is incorrect because the text focuses on the difficulty and significance of the triple axel rather than its historical background.", "'To describe the various techniques used by skaters to successfully perform a triple axel' is incorrect because the text does not provide specific techniques or methods for executing the jump."], "id": 21057}]
