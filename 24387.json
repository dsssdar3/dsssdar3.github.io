[{"domain": "Expression of Ideas", "skill": "Transitions", "passage": "Thomas Hardy, a celebrated English novelist and poet, is famous for his works set in the fictional region of Wessex. Many of his novels, such as 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles' and 'Far from the Madding Crowd,' depict the lives of rural characters struggling with societal constraints. _______ his poetry, although less popular than his prose, also reflects the hardships faced by the people of rural England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "correct_answer": "A", "choices": {"A": "Similarly", "B": "Nonetheless", "C": "On the other hand", "D": "Alternatively"}, "explanation": "A: 'Similarly' is the correct answer because it indicates that Hardy's poetry, like his novels, also reflects the struggles of rural characters in the same time period.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Nonetheless' is incorrect because it implies a contrast or exception, whereas the passage aims to highlight a similarity between Hardy's novels and poetry.", "'On the other hand' is incorrect because it suggests a contrast or alternative, which is not the case as both his novels and poetry depict similar themes.", "'Alternatively' is incorrect because it implies an alternative option or possibility, while the passage aims to show a similarity between Hardy's novels and poetry."], "id": 24387}]
