[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Brazilian samba emerged in the late 19th century, blending African and European musical traditions. It evolved into a lively, energetic dance style often associated with Carnival celebrations. The music features a syncopated rhythm, emphasizing the second beat in each measure, and incorporates various percussion instruments.", "text_2": "Historian Jo\u00e3o Silva argues that samba's development was largely influenced by the cultural exchange between African slaves and European settlers in Brazil. This fusion of musical styles created a unique sound that has become synonymous with Brazilian identity.
