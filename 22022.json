[{"domain": "Information and Ideas", "skill": "Central Ideas and Details", "passage": "Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist, is best known for his groundbreaking work in electricity. In 1800, he invented the voltaic pile, the first device that could produce a continuous flow of electric current. Volta's invention revolutionized the study of electricity, leading to the development of the field of electrochemistry. Additionally, his work laid the foundation for future innovations in electrical engineering and technology.", "question": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?", "correct_answer": "B", "choices": {"A": "To describe the various inventions and discoveries that occurred as a direct result of Alessandro Volta's work", "B": "To highlight Alessandro Volta's significant contributions to the field of electricity through his invention of the voltaic pile", "C": "To argue for the importance of electrochemistry in the broader context of scientific research and technological advancements", "D": "To analyze the influence of Alessandro Volta's work on the careers and achievements of other prominent scientists in the field of electricity"}, "explanation": "B: 'To highlight Alessandro Volta's significant contributions to the field of electricity through his invention of the voltaic pile' is the correct answer because the text mainly focuses on Volta's invention and how it revolutionized the study of electricity.", "distractor_explanation": ["'To describe the various inventions and discoveries that occurred as a direct result of Alessandro Volta's work' is incorrect because the text does not go into detail about specific inventions or discoveries that resulted from Volta's work, but rather mentions the general impact of his invention.", "'To argue for the importance of electrochemistry in the broader context of scientific research and technological advancements' is incorrect because the text does not focus on advocating for electrochemistry; it only states that Volta's work led to the development of the field.", "'To analyze the influence of Alessandro Volta's work on the careers and achievements of other prominent scientists in the field of electricity' is incorrect because the text does not discuss the influence of Volta's work on other scientists, but rather the impact it had on the study of electricity."], "id": 22022}]
