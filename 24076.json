[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Cross-Text Connection", "passage": {"text_1": "Zadie Smith's novel 'Swing Time' explores themes of identity, race, and social class through the lives of two childhood friends. The novel employs a non-linear structure, shifting between past and present, to illustrate how the characters' experiences and choices shape their identities.", "text_2": "Critics have praised Smith's use of structure in 'Swing Time', asserting that the non-linear narrative enhances the novel's exploration of identity and the complex relationship between the two main characters. Some argue that this technique allows readers to see how the characters' lives intertwine and diverge over time."}, "question": "Based on the texts, how would critics mentioned in Text 2 most likely respond to the novel's non-linear structure discussed in Text 1?", "correct_answer": "D", "choices": {"A": "By suggesting that a more traditional linear narrative would be more effective for the novel's themes", "B": "By criticizing it as a confusing and unnecessary narrative choice that hinders the story's development", "C": "By arguing that it detracts from the novel's central themes and makes it difficult for readers to engage", "D": "By appreciating the way it enriches the exploration of identity and the characters' relationship"}, "explanation": "D: 'By appreciating the way it enriches the exploration of identity and the characters' relationship' is the correct answer because Text 2 states that critics have praised Smith's use of a non-linear structure, arguing that it enhances the novel's exploration of identity and the complex relationship between the two main characters.", "distractor_explanation": ["'By criticizing it as a confusing and unnecessary narrative choice that hinders the story's development' is incorrect because Text 2 specifically mentions that critics have praised Smith's use of the non-linear structure.", "'By arguing that it detracts from the novel's central themes and makes it difficult for readers to engage' is incorrect because critics in Text 2 appreciate the non-linear structure for enhancing the exploration of identity and the characters' relationship.", "'By suggesting that a more traditional linear narrative would be more effective for the novel's themes' is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that critics appreciate the non-linear structure for its effectiveness in exploring the novel's themes."], "id": 24076}]
