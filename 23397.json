[{"domain": "Craft and Structure", "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose", "passage": "Wind engineering is a multidisciplinary field that combines meteorology, fluid dynamics, and structural engineering to study wind effects on buildings and structures. Wind engineers use computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing to analyze wind loads on structures, assess their performance, and develop mitigation strategies. This field is essential in designing safe and efficient buildings in areas prone to high winds or extreme weather events.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "correct_answer": "C", "choices": {"A": "Wind engineers only use wind tunnel testing as a method for analyzing wind loads on structures without considering computational fluid dynamics.", "B": "Wind engineering primarily focuses on the meteorological aspect of wind and its impact on the environment, rather than structural engineering.", "C": "Wind engineering is a field that integrates various disciplines to study wind effects on structures and ensure their safety and efficiency.", "D": "The field of wind engineering is solely responsible for the development of mitigation strategies for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes."}, "explanation": "C: 'Wind engineering is a field that integrates various disciplines to study wind effects on structures and ensure their safety and efficiency.' is the correct answer because it accurately captures the main idea of the passage, which is the multidisciplinary nature of wind engineering and its purpose in ensuring the safety and efficiency of structures.", "distractor_explanation": ["'Wind engineering primarily focuses on the meteorological aspect of wind and its impact on the environment, rather than structural engineering.' is incorrect because the passage clearly states that wind engineering combines meteorology, fluid dynamics, and structural engineering to study wind effects on buildings and structures.", "'Wind engineers only use wind tunnel testing as a method for analyzing wind loads on structures without considering computational fluid dynamics.' is incorrect because the passage mentions that wind engineers use both computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing to analyze wind loads on structures.", "'The field of wind engineering is solely responsible for the development of mitigation strategies for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.' is incorrect because, although wind engineering plays a significant role in developing mitigation strategies, the passage does not state that it is solely responsible for this task."], "id": 23397}]
